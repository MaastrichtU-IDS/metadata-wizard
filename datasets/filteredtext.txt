 A common human skin tumour caused activating mutations beta-catenin. WNT signalling orchestrates number developmental programs. In response stimulus, cytoplasmic beta-catenin (encoded CTNNB1) stabilized, enabling downstream transcriptional activation members LEF/TCF family. One target genes beta-catenin/TCF encodes c-MYC, explaining constitutive activation WNT pathway lead cancer, particularly colon. Most colon cancers arise mutations gene encoding adenomatous polyposis coli (APC), protein required ubiquitin-mediated degradation beta-catenin, small percentage colon cancers harbour beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Recently, discovered transgenic mice expressing activated beta-catenin predisposed developing skin tumours resembling pilomatricomas. Given skin adult mice also exhibits signs de novo hair-follicle morphogenesis, wondered whether human pilomatricomas might originate hair matrix cells whether might possess beta-catenin-stabilizing mutations. Here, explore cell origin aetiology common human skin tumour. We found nuclear LEF-1 dividing tumour cells, providing biochemical evidence pilomatricomas derived hair matrix cells. At least 75% tumours possess mutations affecting amino-terminal segment, normally involved phosphorylation-dependent, ubiquitin-mediated degradation protein. This percentage CTNNB1 mutations greater human tumours examined thus far, directly implicates beta-catenin/LEF misregulation major cause hair matrix cell tumorigenesis humans.. HFE mutations analysis 711 hemochromatosis probands: evidence S65C implication mild form hemochromatosis. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) common autosomal recessive genetic disorder iron metabolism. The HFE candidate gene encoding HLA class I-like protein involved HH identified 1996. Two missense mutations described C282Y, accounting 80% 90% HH chromosomes, H63D, associated milder form disease representing 40% 70% non-C282Y HH chromosomes. We report analysis C282Y, H63D, 193A-- > T substitution leading S65C missense substitution large series probands controls. The results confirm C282Y substitution main mutation involved hemochromatosis, accounting 85% carrier chromosomes, whereas H63D substitution represented 39% HH chromosomes carry C282Y mutation. In addition, screening showed S65C substitution significantly enriched probands least one chromosome without assigned mutation. This substitution accounted 7. 8% HH chromosomes neither C282Y H63D. This enrichment S65C among HH chromosomes suggests S65C substitution associated mild form hemochromatosis. Germline BRCA1 alterations population-based series ovarian cancer cases.

Using HeLa cell line expression HFE controlled tetracycline, show expression HFE reduces 55Fe uptake Tf 33% affect endocytic exocytic rates TfR cycling. Therefore, HFE appears reduce cellular acquisition iron Tf within endocytic compartments. HFE specifically reduces iron uptake Tf, non-Tf-mediated iron uptake Fe-nitrilotriacetic acid altered. These results explain decreased ferritin levels seen HeLa cell system demonstrate specific control HFE Tf-mediated pathway iron uptake. These results also implications understanding cellular iron homeostasis organs liver, pancreas, heart, spleen iron loaded hereditary hemochromatotic individuals lacking functional HFE. Mutation haplotype studies familial Mediterranean fever reveal new ancestral relationships evidence high carrier frequency reduced penetrance Ashkenazi Jewish population. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) recessive disorder characterized episodes fever serositis synovitis. The FMF gene (MEFV) cloned recently, four missense mutations identified. Here present data non-Ashkenazi Jewish Arab patients originally found mutations new, ethnically diverse panel. Among 90 symptomatic mutation-positive individuals, 11 mutations accounted 79% carrier chromosomes. Of two mutations novel, one alters residue (680) previously known mutation, (P369S) located exon 3. Consistent another recent report, E148Q mutation observed patients several ethnicities multiple microsatellite haplotypes, haplotype data indicate ancestral relationships non-Jewish Italian Ashkenazi Jewish patients FMF affected populations. Among approximately 200 anonymous Ashkenazi Jewish DNA samples, MEFV carrier frequency 21%, E148Q common mutation. Several lines evidence indicate reduced penetrance among Ashkenazi Jews, especially E148Q, P369S, K695R. Nevertheless, E148Q helps account recessive inheritance Ashkenazi family previously reported unusual case dominantly inherited FMF. The presence three frequent MEFV mutations multiple Mediterranean populations strongly suggests heterozygote advantage geographic region. Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome defective Fas: genotype influences penetrance. Autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) disorder lymphocyte homeostasis immunological tolerance. Most patients heterozygous mutation APT1 gene, encodes Fas (CD95, APO-1), mediator apoptotic pathway crucial lymphocyte homeostasis. Of 17 unique APT1 mutations unrelated ALPS probands, 12 (71%) occurred exons 7-9, encode intracellular portion Fas. In vitro, activated lymphocytes 17 patients showed apoptotic defects exposed anti-Fas agonist monoclonal antibody. Similar defects found Fas-negative cell line transfected cDNAs bearing mutations. In cotransfection experiments, Fas constructs either intra- extracellular mutations caused dominant inhibition apoptosis mediated wild-type Fas. Two missense Fas variants, restricted patients ALPS, identified. Variant A (-1) T Fas signal-sequence cleavage site, mediates apoptosis less well wild-type Fas partially inhibitory, present 13% African American alleles. Among ALPS-associated Fas mutants, dominant inhibition apoptosis much pronounced mutants affecting intracellular, versus extracellular, portion Fas receptor. Mutations causing disruption intracellular Fas death domain also showed higher penetrance ALPS phenotype features mutation-bearing relatives. Significant ALPS-related morbidity occurred 44% relatives intracellular mutations, versus 0% relatives extracellular mutations. Thus, location mutations within APT1 strongly influences development severity ALPS. Mutational analysis genotype-phenotype correlation 29 unrelated Japanese patients X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy.

A population-based study clinical expression hemochromatosis gene. BACKGROUND AND METHODS Hereditary hemochromatosis associated homozygosity C282Y mutation hemochromatosis (HFE) gene chromosome 6, elevated serum transferrin saturation, excess iron deposits throughout body. To assess prevalence clinical expression HFE gene, conducted population-based study Busselton, Australia. In 1994, obtained blood samples determination serum transferrin saturation ferritin levels presence absence C282Y mutation H63D mutation (which may contribute increased hepatic iron levels) 3011 unrelated white adults. We evaluated subjects persistently elevated transferrin-saturation values (45 percent higher) homozygous C282Y mutation. We recommended liver biopsy subjects serum ferritin levels 300 ng per milliliter higher. The subjects followed four years. RESULTS Sixteen subjects (0. 5 percent) homozygous C282Y mutation, 424 (14. 1 percent) heterozygous. The serum transferrin saturation 45 percent higher 15 16 homozygous; 1 subject 43 percent. Four homozygous subjects previously given diagnosis hemochromatosis, 12 not. Seven 12 patients elevated serum ferritin levels 1994; 6 7 increases 1998, 1 decrease, although value remained elevated. The serum ferritin levels four homozygous patients remained normal range. Eleven 16 homozygous subjects underwent liver biopsy; 3 hepatic fibrosis, 1, history excessive alcohol consumption, cirrhosis mild microvesicular steatosis. Eight 16 homozygous subjects clinical findings consistent presence hereditary hemochromatosis, hepatomegaly, skin pigmentation, arthritis. CONCLUSIONS In population white adults northern European ancestry, 0. 5 percent homozygous C282Y mutation HFE gene. However, half homozygous clinical features hemochromatosis, one quarter serum ferritin levels remained normal four-year period. Overexpression DM20 messenger RNA two brothers Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease rare, sex-linked recessive, dysmyelinating disease central nervous system associated mutations myelin proteolipid protein (PLP) gene. Only 25% patients studied Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease exonic mutations gene, underlying cause disease remaining patients unknown. The PLP gene encodes two major alternatively spliced transcripts called PLP DM20. PLP messenger RNA specifically expressed central nervous system tissue, whereas DM20 messenger RNA found central nervous system, cardiac, tissues. We studied cultured skin fibroblasts 2 brothers Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease exhibited detectable exonic mutation PLP gene. Examination RNA cells showed level DM20 messenger RNA elevated sixfold relative male control skin fibroblasts. An unrelated female carrier, also detectable exonic mutation, showed threefold increase DM20 messenger RNA cultured skin fibroblasts. Our findings suggest patients, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease caused overexpression PLP gene transcripts, families 50% increase DM20 messenger RNA females, relative increase affected males, identify female carrier.. Homozygosity novel DTDST mutation child 'broad bone-platyspondylic' variant diastrophic dysplasia. Atypical variant forms well-known chondrodysplasias may pose diagnostic problems. We report girl clinical features suggesting diastrophic dysplasia unusual radiographic features including severe platyspondyly, wide metaphyses, fibular overgrowth, partially reminiscent metatropic dysplasia. The diagnosis clarified molecular analysis DTDST gene, revealed homozygosity previously undescribed mutation leading Q454P substitution 10th transmembrane domain DTDST sulfate transporter. Molecular analysis may particular value atypical cases.. Carrier detection prenatal diagnosis Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease using combination anonymous DNA polymorphisms proteolipid protein (PLP) gene cDNA. We report carrier identification prenatal diagnosis using DNA polymorphisms 2 families X-linked Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD). In families, proteolipid protein (PLP) gene single affected male could traced back unaffected maternal grandfather. Therefore, family contains new mutation. In case prenatal diagnosis, fetus shown cytogenetic analysis female, predict noncarrier PMD based genotype PLP intragenic polymorphism.. Gardner syndrome boy interstitial deletion long arm chromosome 5. We described 15-year-old boy Gardner syndrome (GS), mental retardation, craniofacial abnormalities. High-resolution banding analysis showed interstitial deletion long arm chromosome 5 (q22. 1----q31 1----q31. 1). The breakpoints present case 3 previously reported 5q- patients adenomatous polyposis coli suggest gene responsible GS/or familial polyposis coli (FPC) 5q22 region, result consistent findings linkage studies Type I human complement C2 deficiency. A 28-base pair gene deletion causes skipping exon 6 RNA splicing. Two variants genetic deficiency complement protein C2 (C2D) previously identified. No C2 protein translation detected type I deficiency, type II deficiency characterized selective block C2 secretion. Type I C2 deficiency described family C2 null allele (C2Q0) associated major histocompatibility haplotype/complotype HLA-A25, B18, C2Q0, BfS, C4A4, C4B2, Drw2; extended haplotype occurs 90% C2-deficient individuals (common complotype/haplotype). To determine molecular basis type I C2 deficiency, C2 gene cDNA characterized homozygous type I C2-deficient individual common associated haplotype/complotype. We found 28-base pair deletion type I C2Q0 gene, beginning 9 base pairs upstream 3-end exon 6, generates C2 transcript complete deletion exon 6 (134 base pair) premature termination codon. In studies eight kindred, 28-base pair deletion observed C2Q0 alleles associated common type I deficient complotype/haplotype; deletion present normal C2 type II C2-deficient genes. These data demonstrate 1) type I human complement C2 deficiency caused 28-base pair genomic deletion causes skipping exon 6 RNA splicing, resulting generation premature termination codon, 2) 28-base pair deletion type I C2Q0 gene strongly associated HLA haplotype/complotype A25, B18, C2Q0, BfS, C4A4, C4B2, Drw2, suggesting C2-deficient individuals haplotype/complotype harbor 28-base pair C2 gene deletion, 3) type II C2 deficiency caused different, yet uncharacterized, molecular genetic defect.. (Over)correction FMR1 deficiency YAC transgenics: behavioral physical features. Fragile X syndrome common cause mental retardation involving loss expression FMR1 gene. The role FMR1 remains undetermined protein appears involved RNA metabolism. Fmr1 knockout mice exhibit phenotype similarities humans, macroorchidism behavioral abnormalities. As step toward understanding function FMR1 determination potential therapeutic approaches fragile X syndrome, yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) transgenic mice generated order determine whether Fmr1 knockout mouse phenotype could rescued. Several transgenic lines generated carried entire FMR1 locus extensive amounts flanking sequence. We observed YAC transgene supported production human protein (FMRP) present levels 10 15 times endogenous protein expressed cell- tissue-specific manner. Macro-orchidism absent knockout mice carrying YAC transgene indicating functional rescue human protein. Given complex behavioral phenotype fragile X patients mild phenotype previously reported Fmr1 knockout mouse, performed thorough evaluation Fmr1 knockout phenotype using additional behavioral assays previously reported animal model. The mouse displayed reduced anxiety-related responses increased exploratory behavior. FMR1 YAC transgenic mice overexpressing human protein produce opposing behavioral responses additional abnormal behaviors also observed. These findings significant implications gene therapy fragile X syndrome since overexpression gene may harbor phenotype.. Fabry disease: identification novel alpha-galactosidase A mutations molecular carrier detection use fluorescent chemical cleavage mismatches. Fabry disease (FD) (angiokeratoma corporis diffusum) X-linked inborn error glycosphingolipid metabolism caused defects lysosomal alpha-galactosidase A gene (GLA). The enzymatic defect leads systemic accumulation neutral glycosphingolipids terminal alpha-galactosyl moieties. Clinically, affected hemizygous males angiokeratoma, severe acroparesthesia, renal failure, vasculopathy heart brain. While demonstration alpha-galactosidase deficiency leukocytes diagnostic affected males, enzymatic detection female carriers often inconclusive, due random X-chromosomal inactivation, underlining need molecular investigations accurate genetic counseling. By use chemical cleavage mismatches adapted fluorescence-based detection systems, characterized mutations underlying alpha-Gal A deficiency 16 individuals six unrelated families FD. The mutational spectrum included five missense mutations (C202W, C223G, N224D, R301Q, Q327K) one splice-site mutation [IVS3 G (-1) -- > C]. Studies mRNA level showed latter led altered pre-mRNA splicing consequent alteration mRNA translational reading frame generation premature termination codon translation. By use strategy, carrier status accurately assessed seven at-risk females tested, whereas enzymatic dosages failed diagnose exclude heterozygosity.. Evidence linkage bipolar disorder chromosome 18 parent-of-origin effect. A susceptibility gene chromosome 18 parent-of-origin effect suggested bipolar affective disorder (BPAD). We studied 28 nuclear families selected apparent unilineal transmission BPAD phenotype, using 31 polymorphic markers spanning chromosome 18. Evidence linkage tested affected-sib-pair LOD score methods two definitions affected phenotype. The affected-sibpair analyses indicated excess allele sharing markers 18p within region reported previously. The greatest sharing D18S37 64% bipolar recurrent unipolar (RUP) sib pairs (P =. 0006). In addition, excess sharing paternally, maternally, transmitted alleles observed three markers 18q D18S41, 51 bipolar RUP sib pairs concordant paternally transmitted alleles, 21 pairs discordant (P = 0004). The evidence linkage loci 18p 18q strongest 11 paternal pedigrees, i. e e., father one fathers sibs affected. In pedigrees, greatest allele sharing (81%; P =. 00002) highest LOD score (3. 51; phi = 0. 0) observed D18S41. Our results provide support linkage BPAD chromosome 18 first molecular evidence parent-of-origin effect operating disorder. The number loci involved, precise location, require study BRCA1 mutations population-based sample young women breast cancer. BACKGROUND. Inherited mutations BRCA1 gene associated high risk breast ovarian cancer families. However, little known contribution BRCA1 mutations breast cancer general population. We analyzed DNA samples women enrolled population-based study early-onset breast cancer assess spectrum frequency germ-line BRCA1 mutations young women breast cancer. METHODS. We studied 80 women breast cancer diagnosed age 35, selected basis family history. Genomic DNA studied BRCA1 mutations analysis involving single-strand conformation polymorphisms allele-specific assays. Alterations defined DNA sequencing. RESULTS. Germ-line BRCA1 mutations identified 6 80 women. Four additional rare sequence variants unknown functional importance also identified. Two mutations three rare sequence variants found among 39 women reported family history breast ovarian cancer. None mutations one rare variants identified reference population 73 unrelated subjects. CONCLUSIONS. Alterations BRCA1 identified approximately 10 percent cohort young women breast cancer. The risk harboring mutation limited women family histories breast ovarian cancer. These results represent minimal estimate frequency BRCA1 mutations population. Comprehensive methods identifying BRCA1 mutations understanding importance needed testing women general population undertaken.. Retinoschisin, X-linked retinoschisis protein, secreted photoreceptor protein, expressed released Weri-Rb1 cells. X-linked retinoschisis characterized microcystic-like changes macular region schisis within inner retinal layers, leading visual deterioration males. Many missense protein-truncating mutations causative gene RS1 identified thought inactivating. RS1 encodes 224 amino acid protein, retinoschisin, contains discoidin domain unknown function. We generated polyclonal antibody peptide unique region within retinoschisin, detects protein approximately 28 kDa retinal samples reduced dithiothreitol, multimers sized > 40 kDa non-reducing conditions. A screen human tissues antibody reveals retinoschisin retina specific antibody detects protein similar size bovine murine retinae. We investigated expression pattern retina RS1 mRNA (using situ hybridization riboprobes) retinoschisin (using immunohistochemistry). The antisense riboprobe detected RS1 mRNA photoreceptor layer protein product gene present photoreceptors within inner portions retina. Furthermore, differentiated retinoblastoma cells (Weri-Rb1 cells) found express RS1 mRNA release retinoschisin. These results suggest retinoschisin released photo-receptors functions within inner retinal layers. Thus, X-linked retinoschisis caused abnormalities putative secreted photoreceptor protein first example secreted photo-receptor protein associated retinal dystrophy.. Aberrant splicing CHM gene significant cause choroideremia. Choroideremia (CHM) X-linked progressive degeneration choroid retina. 12% unrelated male patients carry deletions partially cloned CHM gene. In Finland, 120 living CHM patients belonging eight apparently unrelated pedigrees. Molecular deletions involving CHM gene detected three families. We screened remaining five families point mutations. In one large family single nucleotide (T) insertion donor splice site exon C leads two aberrantly spliced mRNAs producing premature stop codon. The mutation assayed easily amplification digestion Msel. Our findings provide additional evidence pathogenetic role CHM mutations provide diagnostic tool one fifth worlds known CHM patients.. X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD): novel mutation ALD gene 6 members family presenting 5 different phenotypes. Fragments adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) cDNA patient adolescent ALD amplified polymerase chain reaction subcloned. Bidirectional sequencing entire coding ALD gene disclosed cytosine guanine transversion nucleotide 1451 exon five, resulting substitution proline 484 arginine. Five nine siblings patient, comprising two cerebral ALD, one adrenomyeloneuropathy, one Addison well symptomatic mother (all accumulating long chain fatty acids) carried mutation, found unaffected persons, five unrelated ALD patients, twenty controls. We propose missense mutation generated disease per se well metabolic defect; different phenotypes, however, must originated means additional pathogenetic factors.. Statistical analysis two stage mutation model von Hippel-Lindau disease, sporadic cerebellar haemangioblastoma renal cell carcinoma. Analysis age incidence curves unilateral bilateral retinoblastoma led Knudson propose hereditary tumours may arise single event sporadic tumours two stage mutation process. It suggested recently sporadic renal cell carcinoma may arise two stage mutation process.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type-3 Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3/MJD) member CAG/polyglutamine repeat disease family. In family disorders, normally polymorphic CAG repeat becomes expanded, resulting expression expanded polyglutamine domain disease gene product. Experimental models polyglutamine disease implicate nucleus pathogenesis; however, link intranuclear expression expanded polyglutamine neuronal dysfunction remains unclear. Here demonstrate ataxin-3, disease protein SCA3/MJD, adopts unique conformation expressed within nucleus transfected cells. The monoclonal antibody 1C2 known preferentially bind expanded polyglutamine, find also binds fragment ataxin-3 containing normal glutamine repeat. In addition, expression ataxin-3 within nucleus exposes glutamine domain full-length non-pathological protein, allowing bind monoclonal antibody 1C2. Fractionation immunochemical experiments indicate novel conformation intranuclear ataxin-3 due proteolysis, suggesting instead association nuclear protein (s) alters structure full-length ataxin-3 exposes polyglutamine domain. This conformationally altered ataxin-3 bound nuclear matrix. The pathological form ataxin-3 expanded polyglutamine domain also associates nuclear matrix. These data suggest early event pathogenesis SCA3/MJD may altered conformation ataxin-3 within nucleus exposes polyglutamine domain.. A zinc finger truncation murine WT1 results characteristic urogenital abnormalities Denys-Drash syndrome . The Wilms tumor -suppressor gene, WT1, plays key role urogenital development, WT1 dysfunction implicated neoplastic (Wilms tumor, mesothelioma, leukemias, breast cancer) nonneoplastic (glomerulosclerosis) disease. The analysis diseases linked specifically WT1 mutations, Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS), provide valuable insight concerning role WT1 development disease. DDS rare childhood disease characterized nephropathy involving mesangial sclerosis, XY pseudohermaphroditism, and/or Wilms tumor (WT). DDS patients constitutionally heterozygous exonic point mutations WT1, include mutations predicted truncate protein within C-terminal zinc finger (ZF) region. We report heterozygosity targeted murine Wt1 allele, Wt1 (tmT396), truncates ZF3 codon 396, induces mesangial sclerosis characteristic DDS adult heterozygous chimeric mice. Male genital defects also evident single case Wilms tumor transcript nontargeted allele showed exon 9 skipping event, implying causal link Wt1 dysfunction Wilms tumorigenesis mice. However, mutant WT1 (tmT396) protein accounted 5% WT1 heterozygous embryonic stem cells WT. This implications regarding mechanism mutant allele exerts effect.

OBJECTIVE To define mutation causing galactosemia patients black American origin galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) activity erythrocytes good clinical outcome. METHODS We discovered mutation caused C-- > T transition base-pair 1158 GALT gene results serine-to-leucine substitution codon 135 (S135L). We developed method screen populations prevalence. We compared galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase among erythrocytes, leukocytes, transformed lymphoblasts, well total body oxidation D- (13C) -galactose 13CO2 among three genotypes GALT (S135L/S135L, Q188R/Q188R, Normal/Normal). RESULTS We found 48% prevalence S135L mutation among 17 black American patients classic galactosemia 1% prevalence population 50 black Americans without galactosemia. The S135L mutation found 84 white patients G/G galactosemia 87 white control subjects without galactosemia. We found normal whole body oxidation D- (13C) -galactose patient homozygous S135L various degrees enzyme impairment among different tissues. CONCLUSIONS The S135L mutation GALT gene prevalent cause galactosemia among black patients. Because GALT activity varies different tissues patients homozygous S135L, may better clinical outcome patients homozygous Q188R treated infancy.. Constitutive regulated modes splicing produce six major myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) isoforms distinct properties. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) prevalent inherited neuromuscular disease adults. The genetic defect CTG triplet repeat expansion 3-untranslated region myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMPK) gene, consisting 15 exons. Using transgenic DMPK-overexpressor mouse model, demonstrate endogenous mouse DMPK gene human DMPK transgene produce six major alternatively spliced mRNAs almost identical cell type-dependent distribution frequencies expression patterns.

In contrast, excision exons 13/14 causes frameshift creates C-terminally truncated protein clearly cell type dependent occurs predominantly smooth muscle. We generated six full-length mouse cDNAs result combinations three major splicing events show transfection cells culture leads production four different approximately 74 kDa full-length (heart-, skeletal muscle- brain-specific) two C-terminally truncated approximately 68 kDa (smooth muscle-specific) isoforms. Information DMPK mRNA protein isoform expression patterns useful recognizing differential effects (CTG) (n) expansion DM manifestation.. Linkage analysis large Brazilian family van der Woude syndrome suggests existence susceptibility locus cleft palate 17p11.2-11.1. van der Woude syndrome (VWS), mapped 1q32-41, characterized pits and/or sinuses lower lip, cleft lip/palate (CL/P), cleft palate (CP), bifid uvula, hypodontia (H). The expression VWS, incomplete penetrance, highly variable. Both occurrence CL/P CP within genealogy recurrence risk < 40% CP among descendants VWS suggested development clefts syndrome influenced modifying genes loci. To test hypothesis, conducted linkage analysis large Brazilian kindred VWS, considering affected individuals CP, regardless whether associated clinical signs VWS. Our results suggest gene 17p11. 2-11 2-11. 1, together VWS gene 1p32-41, enhances probability CP individual carrying two at-risk genes. If hypothesis confirmed VWS pedigrees, represent one first examples gene, mapped linkage analysis, modifies expression major gene. Diverse point mutations human glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene cause enzyme deficiency mild severe hemolytic anemia. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; EC 1. 1. 1. 49) deficiency common genetic abnormality affecting estimated 400 million people worldwide. Clinical biochemical analyses identified many variants exhibiting range phenotypes, well characterized hematological point view. However, now, precise molecular basis remained unknown. We cloned sequenced seven mutant G6PD alleles. In nondeficient polymorphic African variant G6PD A found single point mutation. The six mutants investigated associated enzyme deficiency. In one commonest, G6PD Mediterranean, associated favism among clinical manifestations, single amino acid replacement found (serine----phenylalanine) must responsible decreased stability reduced catalytic efficiency enzyme. Single point mutations also found G6PD Metaponto (Southern Italy) G6PD Ilesha (Nigeria), asymptomatic, G6PD Chatham, observed Indian boy neonatal jaundice. In G6PD " Matera, " known G6PD A-, two separate point mutations found, one G6PD A. In G6PD Santiago, de novo mutation (glycine----arginine) associated severe chronic hemolytic anemia. The mutations observed show striking predominance C----T transitions, CG doublets involved four seven cases. Thus, diverse point mutations may account largely phenotypic heterogeneity G6PD deficiency. Increased high-density lipoprotein levels caused common cholesteryl-ester transfer protein gene mutation. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The plasma cholesteryl-ester transfer protein (CETP) catalyzes transfer cholesteryl esters high-density lipoprotein (HDL) lipoproteins. We recently described Japanese family increased HDL levels CETP deficiency due splicing defect CETP gene. To assess frequency phenotype condition, screened 11 additional families high HDL levels means radioimmunoassay CETP DNA analysis. RESULTS. We found CETP gene mutation four families three different regions Japan. Analysis restriction-fragment-length polymorphisms mutant CETP allele showed probands homozygous identical haplotype. Family members homozygous CETP deficiency (n = 10) moderate hypercholesterolemia (mean total cholesterol level [+/- SD], 7. 01 +/- 0. 83 mmol per liter), markedly increased levels HDL cholesterol (4. 24 +/- 1. 01 mmol per liter) apolipoprotein A-I, decreased levels low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (1. 99 +/- 0. 80 mmol per liter) apolipoprotein B. Members heterozygous deficiency (n = 20), whose CETP levels lower part normal range, moderately increased levels HDL cholesterol apolipoprotein A-I increased ratio HDL subclass 2 HDL subclass 3, compared unaffected family members (1. 5 +/- 0. 8 vs. 0. 7 +/- 0. 4). CETP deficiency found six unrelated subjects elevated HDL cholesterol levels different parts United States. CONCLUSIONS. CETP deficiency appears frequent cause increased HDL levels population Japan, possibly founder effect. The results observed heterozygotes suggest CETP normally plays part regulation levels HDL subclass 2. There evidence premature atherosclerosis families CETP deficiency. In fact, lipoprotein profile persons CETP deficiency potentially antiatherogenic may associated increased life span. Hereditary deficiency seventh component complement recurrent meningococcal infection: investigations Irish family using novel haemolytic screening assay complement activity C7 M/N allotyping. Terminal complement component deficiency predisposes meningococcal infection inherited autosomal co-dominant manner. An Irish family described, 2 3 brothers recurrent meningococcal infection. A novel screening assay used investigate terminal complement deficiency 2 affected brothers found completely deficient seventh component complement (C7). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay C7 revealed lower normal levels remaining brother parents. C7 M/N protein polymorphism allotyping, used investigate segregation C7 deficiency genes, showed apparently complement sufficient brother heterozygous C7 deficient carrier one deficiency genes. Complement screening carried individual suffering recurrent meningococcal infection infection uncommon meningococcal serogroup. Identification complement deficient patients allows implementation strategies prevent recurrent infection.. Mild severe muscular dystrophy associated deletions Xp21 human X chromosome. We analysed 300 patients suffering Duchenne Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD BMD). Deletions characterised encompass either pERT87 (DXS164) locus only, XJ1. 1 (DXS206) HIP25 loci only, three loci. These loci shown lie within DMD region covering several hundred kilobases (kb) DNA. One mildly affected BMD patient possesses deletion least 110 kb including exons DMD gene. Other patients similar exon deletions, smaller deletions, show severe phenotype typical DMD. We conclude studies severity clinical phenotype cannot explained basis size deletion. We discuss context candidate gene sequences. Meiotic segregation analysis RB1 alleles retinoblastoma pedigrees use single-sperm typing. In hereditary retinoblastoma, different epidemiological studies indicated preferential paternal transmission mutant retinoblastoma alleles offspring, suggesting occurrence meiotic drive. To investigate mechanism, analyzed sperm samples six individuals five unrelated families affected hereditary retinoblastoma. Single-sperm typing techniques performed sample study two informative short tandem repeats located either close retinoblastoma gene (RB1). The segregation probability mutant RB1 alleles sperm samples assessed use SPERMSEG program, includes experimental parameters, recombination fractions markers, segregation parameters. A total 2, 952 single sperm six donors analyzed. We detected significant segregation distortion data whole (P =. 0099) significant heterogeneity segregation rate across donors (. 0092). Further analysis shows result explained segregation distortion favor normal allele one donor provide evidence significant segregation distortion donors. The segregation distortion favoring mutant RB1 allele seem occur spermatogenesis, and, thus, meiotic drive may result either various mechanisms, including fertilization advantage better mobility sperm bearing mutant RB1 gene, existence defectively imprinted gene located human X chromosome. Functional differences PDS gene product associated phenotypic variation patients Pendred syndrome non-syndromic hearing loss (DFNB4). The PDS gene encodes transmembrane protein, known pendrin, functions transporter iodide chloride. Mutations gene responsible Pendred syndrome autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing loss DFNB4 locus chromosome 7q31. A screen 20 individuals midwestern USA non-syndromic hearing loss dilated vestibular aqueducts identified three people (15%) PDS mutations. To determine whether PDS mutations individuals Pendred syndrome differ functionally PDS mutations individuals non-syndromic hearing loss, compared three common Pendred syndrome allele variants (L236P, T416P E384G), three PDS mutations reported individuals non-syndromic hearing loss (V480D, V653A I490L/G497S). The mutations associated Pendred syndrome complete loss pendrin-induced chloride iodide transport, alleles unique people DFNB4 able transport iodide chloride, albeit much lower level wild-type pendrin. We hypothesize residual level anion transport sufficient eliminate postpone onset goiter individuals DFNB4. We propose model pendrin function thyroid pendrin transports iodide across apical membrane thyrocyte colloid space.. Late-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy: molecular pathology two siblings. We report new allele arylsulfatase A (ARSA) locus causing late-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD). In allele arginine84, residue highly conserved arylsulfatase gene family, replaced glutamine. In contrast alleles cause early-onset MLD, arginine84 glutamine substitution associated residual ARSA activity. A comparison genotypes, ARSA activities, clinical data 4 individuals carrying allele 81 patients MLD examined, validates concept different degrees residual ARSA activity basis phenotypical variation MLD.. Defective CD95/APO-1/Fas signal complex formation human autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome, type Ia. Heterozygous mutations CD95 (APO-1/Fas) receptor occur individuals autoimmune lymphoproliferative syndrome (ALPS) dominantly interfere apoptosis unknown mechanism. We show local global alterations structure cytoplasmic death domain nine independent ALPS CD95 death-domain mutations result failure bind FADD/MORT1 signaling protein. Despite heterozygosity abnormal allele, lymphocytes ALPS patients showed markedly decreased FADD association loss caspase recruitment activation CD95 crosslinking. These data suggest intracytoplasmic CD95 mutations ALPS impair apoptosis chiefly disrupting death-domain interactions signaling protein FADD/MORT1.. Classical galactosemia mutations galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) gene. Classical galactosemia caused deficiency activity enzyme galactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT), which, turn, caused mutations GALT gene. The disorder exhibits considerable allelic heterogeneity and, end 1998, 150 different base changes recorded 24 different populations ethnic groups 15 countries worldwide. The mutations frequently cited Q188R, K285N, S135L, N314D. Q188R common mutation European populations predominantly European descent. Overall, accounts 60-70% mutant chromosomes, significant differences relative frequency individual populations. Individuals homoallelic Q188R tend severe phenotype keeping virtually complete loss enzyme activity observed vitro expression systems. Globally, K285N rarer, many European populations found 25-40% mutant chromosomes. It invariably associated severe phenotype. S135L found almost exclusively African Americans. In vitro expression results discrepant, individuals carrying S135L appear exhibit GALT activity tissues. Duarte 1 (or Los Angeles) Duarte 2 (or Duarte) variants carry amino acid substitution, N314D, even though D1 associated increased erythrocyte GALT activity D2 reduced activity. N314D linkage disequilibrium base changes differ D1 D2 alleles. N314D impair GALT activity vitro expression systems. However, differences abundance GALT protein lymphoblastoid cells lines D2 D1 individuals. It unclear whether specific molecular changes distinguish D1 D2 alleles account different activities. The considerable genetic heterogeneity documented date undoubtedly contributes phenotypic heterogeneity observed galactosemia. The additional effects nonallelic variation constitutional factors phenotypic variability remain elucidated.. X-linked retinoschisis point mutations XLRS1 gene. BACKGROUND X-linked retinoschisis (XLRS) relatively rare vitreoretinal dystrophy causes visual loss young men. Recently, gene responsible disease, designated XLRS1, identified, several deleterious gene mutations reported. OBJECTIVE To analyze Japanese patients clinically diagnosed XLRS formutational changes XLRS1 gene. METHODS Ten patients XLRS underwent full ophthalmologic examination, including slitlamp biomicroscopy dilated funduscopy. Genomic DNA isolated leukocytes, exons XLRS1 gene amplified polymerase chain reaction analyzed using direct sequencing method. RESULTS Point mutations XLRS1 gene identified 10 patients. The mutations identical 2 pairs brothers. Six point mutations represented missense mutations, 1 nonsense mutation, 1 frameshift mutation. Five mutations newly reported herein. CONCLUSIONS The discovery new point mutations study increases available information regarding spectrum genetic abnormalities clinical manifestations XLRS. However, limited data failed reveal correlation mutation disease phenotype. CLINICAL RELEVANCE Identification mutations XLRS1 gene expanded information clinical manifestations facilitate early diagnosis, appropriate early therapy, genetic counseling regarding prognosis XLRS.. Relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, cognitive performance females phenylalanine hydroxylase deficiency: report Maternal Phenylketonuria Collaborative Study. OBJECTIVE To examine relationship phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) genotypes biochemical phenotype cognitive development maternal phenylketonuria (PKU). METHODOLOGY PAH gene mutations examined 222 hyperphenylalaninemic females enrolled Maternal PKU Collaborative Study (MPKUCS). A total 84 different mutations detected, complete genotype obtained 199 individuals. Based previous knowledge mutation-phenotype associations, 78 mutations could assigned one four classes severity (severe PKU, moderate PKU, mild PKU, mild hyperphenylalaninemia [MHP]). Then, 189 MPKUCS subjects grouped according various combinations mutation classifications. The sample sizes large enough statistical testing four groups least one mutation completely abolishes enzyme activity. These patients considered functionally hemizygous. RESULTS The biochemical phenotype predicted genotype functionally hemizygous patients related significantly assigned phenylalanine level. Cognitive performance (IQ) also significantly related genotype. The IQ PAH-deficient mothers severe PKU mutation combination MHP mutation mild PKU mutation 99 96, respectively, whereas IQ PKU mothers two severe PKU mutations one severe one moderate PKU mutation 83 84, respectively. Of patients PKU, 92% treated childhood. Those untreated treated late lower average IQ scores group mutation combinations. Females moderate mild PKU treated early treated > 6 years showed IQ scores 10 points average group. CONCLUSIONS The reproductive outcome maternal phenylketonuria dependent prenatal metabolic control postnatal environmental circumstances. Both factors depend intellectual resources mother PKU. The significant relationship among genotype, biochemical phenotype, cognitive performance observed present study importance development optimal strategy future treatment females PKU plan pregnancy.. Uncoupling hypomyelination glial cell death mutation proteolipid protein gene. Proteolipid protein (PLP; M (r) 30, 000) highly conserved major polytopic membrane protein myelin cellular function remains obscure. Neurological mutant mice often provide model systems human genetic disorders . Mutations X-chromosome-linked PLP gene lethal, identified first jimpy mouse subsequently patients Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease. The unexplained phenotype mutations includes degeneration premature cell death oligodendrocytes associated hypomyelination. Here show new mouse mutant rumpshaker defined amino-acid substitution Ile-to-Thr residue 186 membrane-embedded domain PLP. Surprisingly, rumpshaker mice, although myelin-deficient, normal longevity full complement morphologically normal oligodendrocytes. Hypomyelination thus genetically separated PLP-dependent oligodendrocyte degeneration. We suggest PLP vital function glial cell development, distinct later role myelin assembly, dichotomy action may explain clinical spectrum Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.. Mutational analysis HGO gene Finnish alkaptonuria patients. Alkaptonuria (AKU), prototypic inborn error metabolism, recently shown caused loss function mutations homogentisate-1, 2-dioxygenase gene (HGO). So far 17 mutations characterised AKU patients different ethnic origin. We describe three novel mutations (R58fs, R330S, H371R) one common AKU mutation (M368V), detected mutational polymorphism analysis HGO gene five Finnish AKU pedigrees. The three novel AKU mutations likely specific Finnish population originated recently.. Putative X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy gene shares unexpected homology ABC transporters. Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) X-linked disease affecting 1/20, 000 males either cerebral ALD childhood adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) adults. Childhood ALD severe form, onset neurological symptoms 5-12 years age. Central nervous system demyelination progresses rapidly death occurs within years. AMN milder form disease onset 15-30 years age progressive course. Adrenal insufficiency (Addisons disease) may remain clinical manifestation ALD. The principal biochemical abnormality ALD accumulation very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) impaired beta-oxidation peroxisomes. The normal oxidation VLCFA-CoA patients fibroblasts suggested gene coding VLCFA-CoA synthetase could candidate gene ALD. Here use positional cloning identify gene partially deleted 6 85 independent patients ALD. In familial cases, deletions segregated disease. An identical deletion detected two brothers presenting different clinical ALD phenotypes. Candidate exons identified computer analysis genomic sequences used isolate complementary DNAs exon connection screening cDNA libraries. The deduced protein sequence shows significant sequence identity peroxisomal membrane protein M (r) 70K involved peroxisome biogenesis belongs ATP-binding cassette superfamily transporters.. Cardiac Na(+) channel dysfunction Brugada syndrome aggravated beta(1)-subunit. BACKGROUND Mutations gene encoding human cardiac Na (+) channel alpha-subunit (hH1) responsible chromosome 3-linked congenital long-QT syndrome (LQT3) idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (IVF). An auxiliary beta (1) -subunit, widely expressed excitable tissues, shifts voltage dependence steady-state inactivation toward negative potentials restores normal gating kinetics brain skeletal muscle Na (+) channels expressed Xenopus oocytes little functional effect cardiac isoform. Here, characterize altered effects human beta (1) -subunit (hbeta (1)) heterologously expressed hH1 mutation (T1620M) previously associated IVF. METHODS AND RESULTS When expressed alone Xenopus oocytes, T1620M exhibited persistent currents, contrast LQT3 mutant channels, midpoint steady-state inactivation (V (1/2)) significantly shifted toward positive potentials wild-type hH1. Coexpression hbeta (1) significantly alter current decay recovery inactivation wild-type hH1; however, shifted V (1/2) accelerated recovery inactivation T1620M. Oocyte macropatch analysis revealed activation kinetics T1620M normal. CONCLUSIONS It suggested coexpression hbeta (1) exposes severe functional defect results greater overlap relationship channel inactivation activation (window current) T1620M, proposed potential pathophysiological mechanism IVF vivo. One possible explanation finding altered alpha-/beta (1) -subunit association mutant.. Autosomal recessive familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus continued secretion mutant weakly active vasopressin. Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus autosomal dominant disorder characterized post-natal development arginine vasopressin (AVP) deficiency due mutations AVP gene. All published mutations affect signal peptide neurophysin-II carrier protein presumed interfere processing preprohormone, leading neuronal damage. We studied unusual Palestinian family consisting asymptomatic first cousin parents three children affected neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. All three affected children homozygous parents heterozygous single novel mutation (C301- > T) exon 1, replacing Pro7 mature AVP Leu (Leu-AVP). Leu-AVP weak agonist approximately 30-fold reduced binding human V2 receptor. Measured radioimmunoassay synthetic Leu-AVP standard, serum Leu-AVP levels elevated three children increased water deprivation high 30 times normal. The youngest child (2 years old) mildly affected Leu-AVP levels similar severely affected 8-year-old brother, suggesting unknown mechanisms may partially compensate deficiency active AVP young children.. Autosomal dominant aniridia linked chromosome 11p13 markers catalase D11S151 large Dutch family. In large pedigree autosomal dominant aniridia, found close linkage aniridia locus AN2 markers catalase (CAT) (zeta = 7. 27 theta = 0. 00) D11S151 (zeta = 3. 86 theta = 0. 10) flanking AN2 locus 11p13. Positive lod scores also obtained 11p13----11p14 markers D11S16 FSHB linkage group CAT/AN2/D11S151. We conclude autosomal dominant aniridia family due mutation AN2 locus 11p13. We excluded linkage (zeta less -2 theta less 0. 18) aniridia chromosome 2p25 marker D2S1 (linked ACP1). Knobloch syndrome involving midline scalp defect frontal region. We report 4-year-old boy Knobloch syndrome. He vitreoretinal degeneration, high myopia, cataract, telecanthus, hypertelorism, high-arched palate. He also defect anterior midline scalp involvement frontal bone documented computed tomography (CT) scan. The brain normal CT scan magnetic resonance imaging. We present review 23 published cases syndrome. Our patient illustrates importance investigating underlying ocular central nervous system pathology whenever midline scalp defects present.. Pendred syndrome: phenotypic variability two families carrying PDS missense mutation. Pendred syndrome comprises congenital sensorineural hearing loss, thyroid goiter, positive perchlorate discharge test. Recently, autosomal recessive disorder shown caused mutations PDS gene, encodes anion transporter called pendrin. Molecular analysis PDS gene performed two consanguineous large families Southern Tunisia comprising total 23 individuals affected profound congenital deafness; missense mutation, L445W, identified affected individuals. A widened vestibular aqueduct found patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scan exploration inner ear. In contrast, goiter present 11 affected individuals, interestingly normal result perchlorate discharge test whenever performed. The present results question sensitivity perchlorate test diagnosis Pendred syndrome support use molecular analysis PDS gene assessment individuals severe profound congenital hearing loss associated inner ear morphological anomaly even absence thyroid goiter.. The type somatic mutation APC familial adenomatous polyposis determined site germline mutation: new facet Knudson's 'two-hit' hypothesis. APC often cited prime example tumor suppressor gene. Truncating germline somatic mutations (or, infrequently, allelic loss) occur tumors FAP (familial adenomatous polyposis). Most sporadic colorectal cancers also two APC mutations. Clues attenuated polyposis, missense germline variants mild disease somatic mutation cluster region (codons 1, 250-1, 450) indicate, however, APC mutations might result simple loss protein function. We found FAP patients germline APC mutations within small region (codons 1, 194-1, 392 most) mainly show allelic loss colorectal adenomas, contrast FAP patients, whose second hits tend occur truncating mutations mutation cluster region. Our results indicate different APC mutations provide cells different selective advantages, mutations close codon 1, 300 providing greatest advantage. Allelic loss selected strongly cells one mutation near codon 1, 300. A different germline-somatic APC mutation association exists FAP desmoids. APC not, therefore, classical tumor suppressor. Our findings also indicate new mechanism disease severity broader spectrum mutations selected tumors, somatic mutation rate effectively higher tumors grow.. Purification human very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase characterization deficiency seven patients. Mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) purified human liver. The molecular masses native enzyme subunit estimated 154 70 kD, respectively. The enzyme found catalyze major part mitochondrial palmitoylcoenzyme A dehydrogenation liver, heart, skeletal muscle, skin fibroblasts (89-97, 86-99, 96-99, 78-87%, respectively). Skin fibroblasts 26 patients suspected disorder mitochondrial beta-oxidation analyzed VLCAD protein using immunoblotting, 7 contained undetectable trace levels enzyme. The seven deficient fibroblast lines characterized measuring acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenation activities, overall palmitic acid oxidation, VLCAD protein synthesis using pulse-chase, confirming diagnosis VLCAD deficiency. These results suggested heterogenous nature mutations causing deficiency seven patients. Clinically, patients VLCAD deficiency exhibited cardiac disease. At least four presented hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This frequency (> 57%) much higher observed patients disorders mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid oxidation may accompanied cardiac disease infants.. A germ line mutation within coding sequence putative 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate binding site hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) Lesch-Nyhan patient: missense mutations within functionally important region probably cause disease. Lesch-Nyhan syndrome caused complete deficiency hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) result heterogeneous group germ line mutations. Identification mutant gene provides valuable information type mutation occurs spontaneously. We report newly identified HPRT mutation Japanese patient Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. This gene, designated HPRT Tokyo, single nucleotide change G A, identified sequencing cDNA amplified polymerase chain reaction. Allele specific oligonucleotide hybridization analysis using amplified genomic DNA showed mutant gene transmitted maternal germ line. This mutation would lead amino acid substitution Asp Gly amino acid position 140 located within putative 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP) binding region. Missense mutations human HPRT deficient patients thus far reported tend accumulate functionally active region. However, comparison data suggested missense synonymous mutations occur coding sequence human germ line HPRT gene, limited percentage missense mutations cause disease. The probability mutation cause disease tends higher missense mutation within functionally important sequence.. In vitro vivo correlations I65T M1V mutations phenylalanine hydroxylase locus. Mutations phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) locus major cause hyperphenylalaninemia. We previously described four mutations (M1V, IVS12nt1, R408W, S349P) PAH locus French Canadians ancestry eastern Quebec. Here report (1) identification another mutation, haplotype 9 chromosome, converts codon 65 isoleucine (ATT) threonine (ACT), (2) expression analysis I65T mutation COS cells demonstrating 75% loss immunoreactive protein enzyme activity, (3) expression analysis prevalent PKU allele (M1V) eastern Quebec, showing nondetectable levels PAH protein activity, finding compatible mutation translation initiation codon. Homozygosity M1V codominant inheritance I65T/R408W associated classical phenylketonuria.. Experimental hemochromatosis due MHC class I HFE deficiency: immune status iron metabolism. The puzzling linkage genetic hemochromatosis histocompatibility loci became even gene involved, HFE, identified. Indeed, within well defined, mainly peptide-binding, MHC class I family molecules, HFE seems perform unusual yet essential function. As yet, understanding HFE function iron homeostasis partial; even open question possible role immune system. To advance avenues, report deletion HFE alpha1 alpha2 putative ligand binding domains vivo. HFE-deficient animals analyzed comprehensive set metabolic immune parameters. Faithfully mimicking human hemochromatosis, mice homozygous deletion develop iron overload, characterized higher plasma iron content raised transferrin saturation well elevated hepatic iron load. The primary defect could, indeed, traced augmented duodenal iron absorption. In parallel, measurement gut mucosal iron content well iron regulatory proteins allows informed evaluation various hypotheses regarding precise role HFE iron homeostasis. Finally, extensive phenotyping primary secondary lymphoid organs including gut provides compelling evidence obvious immune-linked function HFE..

Determination carrier status Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome flow cytometric analysis Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein expression peripheral blood mononuclear cells. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) caused defects WAS protein (WASP) gene X chromosome. Previous study disclosed flow cytometric analysis intracellular WASP expression (FCM-WASP analysis) lymphocytes useful diagnosis WAS patients. Lymphocytes WAS patients showed WASPdim instead WASPbright. Here report FCM-WASP analysis monocytes could useful tool WAS carrier diagnosis. Monocytes nine WAS carriers showed varied population WASPdim together WASPbright. None control individuals possessed WASPdim population. In contrast, lymphocytes carriers except two lacked WASPdim population. The difference WASPdim population monocytes lymphocytes observed WAS carriers suggests WASP plays critical role development lymphocytes monocytes. The present studies suggest skewed X-chromosomal inactivation pattern observed WAS carrier peripheral blood cells fixed hemopoietic stem cell level progresses lineage commitment.. Linkage DNA markers Xq28 adrenoleukodystrophy adrenomyeloneuropathy present within family. We present large kindred contained patients either adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN). The pedigree clearly supported X-linked mode inheritance nonneonatal form ALD/AMN. Analysis DNA markers Xq28 suggested segregation ALD AMN identical haplotype. This indicated nonneonatal ALD AMN caused mutation gene Xq28. It showed, furthermore, phenotypic differences ALD AMN necessarily consequence allelic heterogeneity due different mutations within gene. The maximal lod score linkage ALD/AMN gene multiallelic anonymous DNA marker DXS52 3. 0 recombination fraction 0. 00. This made prenatal presymptomatic diagnosis heterozygote detection DNA analysis marker reliable. Further investigation HEXA gene intron 9 donor splice site mutation frequently found non-Jewish Tay-Sachs disease patients British Isles. In previous study found Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) causing mutation intron 9 donor splice site HEXA gene occurs high frequency non-Jewish patients carriers British Isles. It found frequently subjects Irish, Scottish, Welsh origin compared English origin (63% 31% respectively).

The gene human apolipoprotein C2 (APOC2), situated proximal long arm chromosome 19, closely linked gene common form adult muscular dystrophy, myotonic dystrophy (DM). Six APOC2 RFLPs (TaqI, BglI, BanI, BamHI, NcoI, AvaII) identified date. We conducted comprehensive DM linkage study utilizing six RFLPs involving 50 families 372 individuals. The informative RFLPs are, descending order, NcoI (lod = 6. 64, theta = 0. 05), BglI (lod = 6. 12, theta = 0. 05), AvaII (lod = 6. 02, theta = 0. 03), BanI (lod = 5. 76, theta = 0. 04), TaqI (lod = 4. 29, theta = 0. 06), BamHI (lod = 1. 75, theta = 0. 01). A substantial increase lod scores seen individual RFLPs obtained linkage entire APOC2 haplotype (composed six RFLPs) studied (lod = 17. 87, theta = 0. 04). We observed significant inter-APOC2 RFLP linkage disequilibrium. Consequently, three informative RFLPs found BanI, TaqI, either BglI, AvaII, NcoI polymorphisms. We also demonstrate linkage disequilibrium DM APOC2 French-Canadian population (standardized disequilibrium constant phi =. 22, chi 2 = 5. 12, df = 1, P less 0. 04). This represents first evidence linkage disequilibrium APOC2 DM locus. A retrospective anonymous pilot study screening newborns HFE mutations Scandinavian populations. We retrospectively analyzed 837 random anonymized dried blood spot (DBS) samples neonatal screening programs Scandinavia mutations HFE, candidate gene hemochromatosis. We found C282Y allele frequencies 2. 3% (+ 2. 0%) (-1. 3%) Greenland, 4. 5% +/-1. 9% Iceland, 5. 1% +/-2. 3% Faeroe Islands, 8. 2% +/-2. 7% Denmark. The high prevalence HFE mutations Denmark suggests population screening C282Y mutation could highly advantageous terms preventive health care. Long-term follow-up evaluation C282Y homozygotes H63D/C282Y compound heterozygotes give indication penetrance mutations. Hereditary TP53 codon 292 somatic P16INK4A codon 94 mutations Li-Fraumeni syndrome family. Li-Fraumeni syndrome autosomal dominant disorder characterized various types cancer childhood adult cases. Although hereditary TP53 mutation rare different human cancers, frequently reported Li-Fraumeni syndrome. On hand, hereditary mutations TP57KIP2, P15INK4B, P16INK4A, affect cell cycle similar TP53, observed types cancer. In Turkish family diagnosis Li-Fraumeni syndrome, analyzed mutation pattern TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, P16INK4A peripheral blood, loss heterozygosity (homo/hemizygous deletion) pattern TP53 P15INK4B/P16INK4A two tumor tissues. The propositus seminoma, daughter medulloblastoma, one healthy cousins, TP53 codon 292 missense point mutation (AAA-- > ATA; Lys-- > Ile) peripheral blood cells. Tumor tissue obtained propositus seminoma revealed loss heterozygosity TP53 gene. In analyses tumor tissues propositus daughter, P16INK4A codon 94 missense point mutation (GCG-- > GAG; Ala-- > Glu) observed hereditary TP53 mutation. P16INK4A codon 94 mutation observed family novel mutation Li-Fraumeni syndrome. No gene alteration TP53, P57KIP2, P15INK4B, P16INK4A observed. Existence P16INK4A mutation hereditary TP53 mutation without loss heterozygosity TP53 gene (seminoma/medulloblastoma) may evidence common mechanism involved tumorogenesis. The gene alterations TP53 P16INK4A genes may used tumor markers family.. An amino-acid substitution involved phenylketonuria linkage disequilibrium DNA haplotype 2. Phenylketonuria (PKU) autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused deficiency hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH, phenylalanine 4-monooxygenase, EC 1. 14. 16. 1). PKU common inborn error amino-acid metabolism caucasian populations approximately 1 50 individuals carriers PKU allele. To define molecular basis PKU, characterized twelve restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) haplotypes PAH locus northern European population observed 90% PKU alleles population confined four common RFLP haplotypes. We recently reported splicing mutation PAH gene associated RFLP haplotype 3 present 40% mutant alleles. We report molecular lesion associated RFLP haplotype 2 mutant allele. This defect caused C-to-T transition exon 12 resulting amino-acid substitution (Arg Trp) residue 408 PAH. Direct hybridization analysis point mutation using specific oligonucleotide probe demonstrated mutation also linkage disequilibrium RFLP haplotype 2 alleles make 20% mutant PAH genes The effects dystrophin gene mutations ERG mice humans. PURPOSE. The authors earlier findings negative electroretinogram (ERG) boy Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) led investigate dystrophin gene deletions ERGs five boys DMD. The authors wanted determined whether similar ERG findings animal model DMD, mdx mouse. METHODS. Ganzfeld ERGs recorded five boys DMD complete ophthalmic examination. The dystrophin gene analyzed Southern blot hybridization. ERGs recorded anesthetized mdx control mice modified Grass photostimulator (Grass Instrument Company, Quincy, MA). RESULTS. Ophthalmic examinations five boys normal findings, yet abnormal negative ERG recorded subject. The subjects gene deletions variable, ranging large deletions detectable deletions. The ERGs mdx mice normal differ significantly control mice. CONCLUSIONS. The authors believe unique ERG recorded human subjects manifestation DMD associated defects dystrophin gene locus represents new clinical entity. The ERG mdx mouse may spared several reasons, including milder effects mouse gene defect, differences muscle retinal gene product, species differences biochemical role dystrophin. The ERG shows promise becoming noninvasive diagnostic tool DMD milder allelic forms.. Eight novel inactivating germ line mutations APC gene identified denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis. Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) dominantly inherited condition predisposing colorectal cancer. The recent isolation responsible gene (adenomatous polyposis coli APC) facilitated search germ line mutations affected individuals. Previous authors used RNase protection assay single-strand conformation polymorphisms procedure screen mutations. In study used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE). DGGE analysis 10 APC exons (4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, part 15) 33 unrelated Dutch FAP patients led identification eight novel germ line mutations resulting stop codons frameshifts. The results reported indicate (1) familial adenomatous polyposis caused extremely heterogeneous spectrum point mutations; (2) mutations found study chain terminating; (3) DGGE represents rapid sensitive technique detection mutations unusually large APC gene. An extension DGGE analysis entire coding region sufficient number clinically well-characterized, unrelated patients facilitate establishment genotype-phenotype correlations. On hand, occurrence extremely heterogeneous spectrum mutations spread throughout entire length large APC gene among FAP patients indicates approach may useful rapid presymptomatic diagnostic procedure routine laboratory. Nevertheless, DGGE approach incidentally led identification common polymorphism exon 13. Such intragenic polymorphisms offer practical approach rapid procedure presymptomatic diagnosis FAP linkage analysis informative families.. Novel mutations XLRS1 causing retinoschisis, including first evidence putative leader sequence change. Juvenile retinoschisis X-linked recessive disease caused mutations XLRS1 gene. We screened 31 new unrelated patients families XLRS1 mutations addition previously reported mutations 60 families (Retinoschisis Consortium, Hum Mol Genet 1998; 7 1185-1192). Twenty-three different mutations including 12 novel ones identified 28 patients. Mutations identified study include 19 missense mutations, two nonsense mutations, one intragenic deletion, four microdeletions, one insertion, one intronic sequence substitution likely result splice site defect. Two novel mutations, c. 38T-- > C (L13P) c. 667T-- > C (C223R), respectively, present first genetic evidence functional significance putative leader peptide sequence functional significance carboxyl terminal XLRS1 protein beyond discoidin domain. Mutations 25 families localized exons 4-6, emphasizing critical functional significance discoidin domain XLRS1 protein Clinical use DNA markers linked gene Duchenne muscular dystrophy. Seventy families Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) known Institute Child Health fall three categories respect potential linkage analysis X chromosome DNA markers RC8 L1. 28 bridge DMD gene. Families least one obligatory female heterozygote (n = 13). Here prediction exclusion DMD gene transmission may possible, accuracy dependent closeness linkage DNA marker (s) DMD gene; illustrative case reported. Families single affected boy, also one healthy brothers (n = 26). Given informative restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), probability boy represents new mutation reassessed; also possible exclude DMD gene sister. Families single affected boy brother (n = 30). Here exclusion DMD gene sister may possible. Only one family possibility useful linkage analysis. The linkage analysis required described, need check DMD families informative RFLPs stressed. Molecular characterization glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency patients Chinese descent identification new base substitutions human G6PD gene. The underlying DNA changes associated glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) -deficient Asians extensively investigated. To fill gap, sequenced G6PD gene 43 G6PD-deficient Chinese whose G6PD well characterized biochemically. DNA samples obtained peripheral blood individuals sequencing using direct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) sequencing procedure. From 43 samples, identified five different types nucleotide substitutions G6PD gene cDNA 1388 G A (Arg His); cDNA 1376 G T (Arg Leu); cDNA 1024 C T (Leu Phe); cDNA 392 G T (Gly Val); cDNA 95 A G (His Arg). These five nucleotide substitutions account 83% 43 G6PD-deficient samples substitutions reported non-Asians. The substitutions found cDNA 392 cDNA 1024 new findings. The substitutions cDNA 1376 1388 account 50% 43 samples examined indicating high prevalence two alleles among G6PD-deficient Chinese. Our findings add support notion diverse point mutations may account largely much phenotypic heterogeneity G6PD deficiency.. Norrie disease gene: characterization deletions possible function. Positional cloning experiments resulted recently isolation candidate gene Norrie disease (pseudoglioma; NDP), severe X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder. Here report isolation analysis human genomic DNA clones encompassing NDP gene. The gene spans 28 kb consists 3 exons, first entirely contained within 5 untranslated region. Detailed analysis genomic deletions Norrie patients shows heterogeneous, size position. By PCR analysis, found expression NDP gene confined eye brain. An extensive DNA protein sequence comparison human NDP gene related genes database revealed homology cysteine-rich protein-binding domains immediate--early genes implicated regulation cell proliferation. We propose NDP molecule related function genes may involved pathway regulates neural cell differentiation proliferation.. Prenatal diagnosis Wolman disease. Two pregnancies risk Wolman disease monitored assay electrophoresis acid lipase cultured amniotic-fluid cells. Cells patient 1 5% control levels acid lipase, using 14C-triolein substrate; however, artificial substrates (esters 4-methylumbelliferone p-nitrophenol) used measure acid lipase, cells 30% control levels. Electrophoresis cell extracts revealed absence A form acid lipase, consistent diagnosis Wolman disease. Analysis fetal tissues following prostaglandin termination pregnancy confirmed diagnosis. Assay fetal-skin fibroblasts 14C-triolein, well artificial substrates, showed marked deficiency acid lipase activity. Electrophoresis fetal-tissue extracts also demonstrated absence A form acid lipase. Amniotic-fluid cells patient 2 showed normal levels acid lipase substrates tested; electrophoretic pattern acid lipase normal. The results suggest prenatal diagnosis Wolman disease made using radioassay acid lipase and/or electrophoresis.. Somatic mutations BRCA1 gene sporadic ovarian tumours. The BRCA1 gene chromosome 17q21 responsible autosomal dominant syndrome increased susceptibility breast ovarian cancer somatic mutations tumours yet described. To study potential role BRCA1 sporadic carcinogenesis, analysed genomic DNA tumour normal fractions 47 ovarian cancers mutations BRCA1 using single-strand conformation polymorphism technique. We describe somatic mutations DNA four tumours also loss heterozygosity (LOH) BRCA1 intragenic marker. Our data support tumour suppressor mechanism BRCA1; somatic mutations LOH may result inactivation BRCA1 least small number ovarian cancers.. Skewed X inactivation female MZ twin results Duchenne muscular dystrophy. One female MZ twins presented muscular dystrophy. Physical examination, creatine phosphokinase levels, muscle biopsy consistent Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). However, sex diagnosed limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. With cDNA probes DMD gene, gene deletion detected twins mother. The de novo mutation arose mother shown novel junction fragments generated HindIII, PstI, TaqI probed cDNA8. Additional evidence large gene deletion given novel SfiI junction fragments detected probes p20, J-Bir, J-66 pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Immunoblot analysis muscle affected twin showed dystrophin normal size reduced amount. Immunofluorescent visualization dystrophin revealed foci dystrophin-positive fibers adjacent foci dystrophin-negative fibers. These data indicate affected twin manifesting carrier abnormal DMD gene, myopathy direct result underexpression dystrophin. Cytogenetic analysis revealed normal karyotypes, eliminating possibility translocation affecting DMD gene function. Both linkage analysis DNA fingerprint analysis revealed twin two different X chromosomes, eliminating possibility uniparental disomy mechanism DMD expression. On basis methylation differences paternal maternal X chromosomes MZ twins, propose uneven lyonization (X chromosome inactivation) underlying mechanism disease expression affected female.. Coincident Kaposi sarcoma T-cell lymphoma patient Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. A 24 year old male history eczema, recurrent mild infections, thrombocytopenia consistent Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) presented mediastinal mass, generalized lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, severe thrombocytopenia. Studies immune function including immunoglobulin levels T-cell subsets normal. Furthermore, T lymphocytes proliferated normally response phytohemagglutinin, concanavalin A, combination neuraminidase/galactose oxidase. However, proliferative responses anti-CD43 antibody periodate diminished, consistent clinical diagnosis WAS. An initial inguinal lymph node biopsy surprisingly revealed Kaposi sarcoma. However, following splenectomy increase platelet count, biopsy mediastinal mass revealed T-cell large cell lymphoma. Studies biopsied tissue presence Epstein-Barr virus cytomegalovirus negative, studies blood, including polymerase chain reaction, presence human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). This first report Kaposi sarcoma arising patient congenital immunodeficiency syndrome. Although Kaposi sarcoma arise face severe immunosuppression follows allograft transplantation patients infected HIV, postulate longevity face mild immunosuppression major factor development Kaposi sarcoma patient.. Treatment cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis: effects chenodeoxycholic acid, pravastatin, combined use. Treatments oral administration chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) alone, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG) CoA reductase inhibitor (pravastatin) alone, combination two drugs attempted 7 patients cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). CDCA treatment dose 300 mg/day reduced serum cholestanol (67. 3% reduction), lathosterol (50. 8%), campesterol (61. 7%) sitosterol (12. 7%). However, sera patients changed " atherogenic "; total cholesterol, triglyceride low-density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol increased, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol decreased. Contrarily, pravastatin dose 10 mg/day improved sera patients markedly " anti-atherogenic ", reductions cholestanol (30. 4%), lathosterol (44. 0%), campesterol (22. 9%) sitosterol (9. 6%) inadequate. Combined treatment CDCA pravastatin showed good overlapping effects drug alone. The sera patients apparently " anti-atherogenic " CDCA treatment. Serum cholestanol concentration still 2. 7 times higher controls, serum lathosterol level within normal range, indicating enhancement overall cholesterol synthesis patients sufficiently suppressed. Plant sterol levels also within normal range. The combination CDCA pravastatin good treatment CTX, based improvement serum lipoprotein metabolism, suppression cholesterol synthesis, reductions cholestanol plant sterol levels. In 7 patients, progression disease arrested, dramatic effects clinical manifestations, xanthoma, electrophysiological findings could found treatment drugs Combined genetic deficiency C6 C7 man. By routine screening sera, subject discovered showed sub-total deficiency C6 C7. No clinical disease associated deficiency transmitted subjects family single genetic characteristic, C6 deficiency associated silent allele structural locus. The propositus found low quantities abnormal C6 antigenically deficient smaller size normal C6 (110, 000 daltons compared 140, 000 daltons) small quantities apparently normal C7. It concluded likely explanation defect subject structural mutation C6 gene produces hyopsynthesis C6 also closely linked gene C7. These findings suggest possibility C6 C7 may function single genetic unit primary transcript copied genome includes information proteins.. Partial deletion 8q without Langer-Giedion syndrome: recognisable syndrome. We report two de novo cases del (8) (pter----q24. 1 ) breakpoints involving distal part band 8q24. 1 1. The clinical features similar obvious stigmata Langer-Giedion syndrome (LGS). There three cases reported deletion chromosome 8 approximately breakpoint, one without LGS similarities cases, two LGS. Our findings would support observation critical segment assignment LGS proximal involves proximal part 8q24. 1, review published reports suggests aetiology LGS may complex issue Iron-dependent self-assembly recombinant yeast frataxin: implications Friedreich ataxia. Frataxin deficiency primary cause Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), autosomal recessive cardiodegenerative neurodegenerative disease. Frataxin nuclear-encoded mitochondrial protein widely conserved among eukaryotes. Genetic inactivation yeast frataxin homologue (Yfh1p) results mitochondrial iron accumulation hypersensitivity oxidative stress. Increased iron deposition evidence oxidative damage also observed cardiac tissue cultured fibroblasts patients FRDA. These findings indicate frataxin essential mitochondrial iron homeostasis protection iron-induced formation free radicals. The functional mechanism frataxin, however, still unknown. We expressed mature form Yfh1p (mYfh1p) Escherichia coli analyzed function vitro. Isolated mYfh1p soluble monomer (13, 783 Da) contains iron shows significant tendency self-associate. Aerobic addition ferrous iron mYfh1p results assembly regular spherical multimers molecular mass approximately 1. 1 MDa (megadaltons) diameter 13 +/-2 nm. Each multimer consists approximately 60 subunits sequester > 3, 000 atoms iron. Titration mYfh1p increasing iron concentrations supports stepwise mechanism multimer assembly. Sequential addition iron chelator reducing agent results quantitative iron release concomitant disassembly multimer, indicating mYfh1p sequesters iron available form. In yeast mitochondria, native mYfh1p exists monomer higher-order species molecular weight > 600, 000. After addition (55) Fe medium, immunoprecipitates species contain > 16 atoms (55) Fe per molecule mYfh1p. We propose iron-dependent self-assembly recombinant mYfh1p reflects physiological role frataxin mitochondrial iron sequestration bioavailability.. Human mutations glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase reflect evolutionary history. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) cytosolic enzyme encoded housekeeping X-linked gene whose main function produce NADPH, key electron donor defense oxidizing agents reductive biosynthetic reactions. Inherited G6PD deficiency associated either episodic hemolytic anemia (triggered fava beans agents) life-long hemolytic anemia. We show evolutionary analysis key understanding biology housekeeping gene. From alignment amino acid (aa) sequence 52 glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) species 42 different organisms, found striking correlation aa replacements cause G6PD deficiency humans sequence conservation G6PD two-thirds replacements highly moderately conserved (50-99%) aa; relatively fully conserved aa (where might lethal) poorly conserved aa, presumably simply would cause G6PD deficiency. This consistent notion human mutants residual enzyme activity null mutations lethal stage development. Comparing distribution mutations human housekeeping gene evolutionary conservation useful tool pinpointing amino acid residues important stability function corresponding protein. In view current explosive increase full genome sequencing projects, tool become rapidly available numerous genes.. Regionally clustered APC mutations associated severe phenotype occur high frequency new mutation cases adenomatous polyposis coli. Germline mutation APC 5q21-22 results dominantly inherited syndrome adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Somatic mutation gene early event colorectal tumourigenesis. Both types mutation concentrated 5 half exon 15. We used single strand conformational polymorphism (SSCP) heteroduplex analysis screen variants region gene total 45 affected unrelated individuals. Eighteen patients family history disease; 11 classified severe phenotype, based early age presentation cancer development. This compared 6 27 familial cases. A 5 bp deletion codon 1309 reported occur 10-15% unselected APC patients worldwide, found 5 18 new mutation cases 4 27 familial cases nine classed severe. A 3 new mutations 1 familial mutation located downstream codon 1309, individuals similarly classed phenotypically severe. In contrast APC mutations detected affected individuals average phenotype located prior codon 1309. The frequent association severe phenotype fresh mutation may explain apparent conflict high mutation rate (20-30%) condition, average, lethal post-reproductive age.. Analysis alkaptonuria (AKU) mutations polymorphisms reveals CCC sequence motif mutational hot spot homogentisate 1,2 dioxygenase gene (HGO). We recently showed alkaptonuria (AKU) caused loss-of-function mutations homogentisate 1, 2 dioxygenase gene (HGO). Herein describe haplotype mutational analyses HGO seven new AKU pedigrees. These analyses identified two novel single-nucleotide polymorphisms (INV4 + 31A-- > G INV11 + 18A-- > G) six novel AKU mutations (INV1-1G-- > A, W60G, Y62C, A122D, P230T, D291E), illustrates remarkable allelic heterogeneity found AKU. Reexamination 29 mutations polymorphisms thus far described HGO shows nucleotide changes randomly distributed; CCC sequence motif inverted complement, GGG, preferentially mutated. These analyses also demonstrated nucleotide substitutions HGO involve CpG dinucleotides, illustrates important differences HGO genes occurrence mutation specific short-sequence motifs. Because CCC sequence motifs comprise significant proportion (34. 5%) mutated bases observed HGO, conclude CCC triplet mutational hot spot HGO. Further evidence heterogeneity glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency Papua New Guinea. Four new G6PD variants characterized individuals Papua New Guinea. This study demonstrates previously reported Markham variant newly characterized Salata variant may widely distributed Papua New Guinea. Th data presented together previously published studies demonstrate degree heterogeneity G6PD deficiency much higher regions world G6PD deficiency common.. Overgrowth oral mucosa facial skin, novel feature aspartylglucosaminuria. Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) lysosomal storage disorder caused deficiency aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA). The main symptom progressive mental retardation. A spectrum different mutations reported disease, one missense mutation (Cys163Ser) responsible majority Finnish cases. We able examine 66 Finnish AGU patients changes oral mucosa 44 changes facial skin. Biopsy specimens 16 oral lesions, 12 associated teeth, plus two facial lesions studied histologically. Immunohistochemical staining AGA performed 15 oral specimens. Skin seborrhoeic adolescent adult patients, erythema facial skin already common childhood. Of 44 patients, nine (20%) facial angiofibromas, tumours primarily occurring association tuberous sclerosis. Oedemic buccal mucosa (leucoedema) gingival overgrowths frequent AGU patients controls (p < 0. 001). Of 16 oral mucosal lesions studied histologically, 15 represented fibroepithelial epithelial hyperplasias reactive nature. Cytoplasmic vacuolisation evident four. Immunohistochemically, expression AGA AGU patients mucosal lesions differ seen corresponding lesions normal subjects. Thus, high frequency mucosal overgrowth AGU patients appear directly associated lysosomal storage alterations level AGA expression. Molecular characterization galactosemia (type 1) mutations Japanese. We characterized two novel mutations galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) gene two Japanese patients GALT deficiency identified N314D R333W mutations, previously found Caucasians. One novel missense mutation G-to-A transition exon 8, resulting substitution arginine histidine codon 231 (R231H). GALT activity R231H mutant construct reduced 15% normal controls COS cell expression system. The splicing mutation, A-to-G transition 38th nucleotide exon 3 (318A-- > G), resulting 38-bp deletion GALT cDNA activating cryptic splice acceptor site. In seven Japanese families (14 alleles classic form one allele Duarte variant) GALT deficiency, R231H 318A-- > G mutations found alleles proband. The N314D R333W mutations found one allele each. The Q188R prevalent United States Japanese patients. The N314D mutation associated Duarte variant Japanese persons, well United States. We speculate classic galactosemia mutations appear differ Japanese Caucasian patients. Our limited data set galactosemia mutations Japanese suggests N314D GALT mutation encoding Duarte variant arose Asian Caucasian people diverged classic galactosemia mutations arose and/or accumulated divergence Asian Caucasian populations.. Linkage disequilibrium mapping isolated founder populations: diastrophic dysplasia Finland. Linkage disequilibrium mapping isolated populations provides powerful tool fine structure localization disease genes. Here, Luria Delbrucks classical methods analysing bacterial cultures adapted study human isolated founder populations order estimate (i) recombination fraction disease locus marker; (ii) expected degree allelic homogeneity population; (iii) mutation rate marker loci. Using methods, report striking linkage disequilibrium diastrophic dysplasia (DTD) Finland indicating DTD gene lie within 0. 06 centimorgans (or 60 kilobases) CSF1R gene. Predictions allelic homogeneity Finland mutation rates simple sequence repeats confirmed independent observations. Mutations TNFRSF11A, affecting signal peptide RANK, cause familial expansile osteolysis. Familial expansile osteolysis (FEO, MIM 174810) rare, autosomal dominant bone disorder characterized focal areas increased bone remodelling. The osteolytic lesions, develop usually long bones early adulthood, show increased osteoblast osteoclast activity. Our previous linkage studies mapped gene responsible FEO interval less 5 cM D18S64 D18S51 chromosome 18q21. 2-21 2-21. 3 large Northern Irish family. The gene encoding receptor activator nuclear factor-kappa B (RANK; ref. 5), TNFRSF11A, maps region. RANK essential osteoclast formation. We identified two heterozygous insertion mutations exon 1 TNFRSF11A affected members four families FEO familial Paget disease bone (PDB). One duplication 18 bases duplication 27 bases, affected signal peptide region RANK molecule. Expression recombinant forms mutant RANK proteins revealed perturbations expression levels lack normal cleavage signal peptide. Both mutations caused increase RANK-mediated nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) signalling vitro, consistent presence activating mutation. Adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein compensate functionally adrenoleukodystrophy protein deficiency (X-ALD): implications therapy. Inherited defects peroxisomal ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter adrenoleukodystrophy protein (ALDP) lead lethal peroxisomal disorder X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), efficient treatment established far. Three peroxisomal ABC transporters currently known adrenoleukodystrophy-related protein (ALDRP), 70 kDa peroxisomal membrane protein (PMP70) PMP70- related protein. By using transient stable overexpression human cDNAs encoding ALDP closest relative ALDRP, could restore impaired peroxisomal beta-oxidation fibroblasts X-ALD patients. The pathognomonic accumulation long chain fatty acids could also prevented overexpression ALDRP immortalized X-ALD cells. Immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated functional replacement ALDP ALDRP due stabilization mutated ALDP itself. Moreover, able restore peroxisomal beta-oxidation defect liver ALDP-deficient mice stimulation ALDRP PMP70 gene expression dietary treatment peroxisome proliferator fenofibrate. These results suggest correction biochemical defect X-ALD could possible drug-induced overexpression ectopic expression ALDRP.. The normal Huntington disease (HD) allele, closely linked gene, influences age onset HD. We evaluated hypothesis Huntington disease (HD) influenced normal HD allele comparing transmission patterns genetically linked markers D4S10 locus normal parent age onset affected offspring. Analysis information 21 sibships 14 kindreds showed significant tendency sibs similar onset ages share D4S10 allele normal parent. Affected sibs inherited different D4S10 alleles normal parent tended variable ages onset. These findings suggest expression HD modulated normal HD allele closely linked locus.. Synergistic effect histone hyperacetylation DNA demethylation reactivation FMR1 gene. Most fragile X syndrome patients expansion (CGG) (n) sequence > 200 repeats (full mutation) FMR1 gene responsible condition. Hypermethylation expanded repeat FMR1 promoter almost always present apparently suppresses transcription, resulting absence FMR1 protein. We recently showed transcriptional reactivation FMR1 full mutations achieved inducing DNA demethylation 5-azadeoxycytidine (5-azadC). The level histone acetylation another important factor regulating gene expression; therefore, treated lymphoblastoid cell lines non-mosaic full mutation patients three drugs capable inducing histone hyperacetylation. We observed consistent, although modest, reactivation FMR1 gene 4-phenylbutyrate, sodium butyrate trichostatin A, shown RT-PCR. However, report combining drugs 5-azadC results 2- 5-fold increase FMR1 mRNA levels obtained 5-azadC alone, thus showing marked synergistic effect histone hyperacetylation DNA demethylation reactivation FMR1 full mutations.. Genetic heterogeneity X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta. The AMELX gene located Xp22. 1-p22. 3 encodes enamel protein amelogenin implicated gene responsible inherited dental abnormality X-linked amelogenesis imperfecta (XAI). Three families XAI investigated using polymorphic DNA markers flanking position AMELX. Using two-point linkage analysis, linkage established XAI several markers two families, combined lod score 6. 05 DXS16 theta = 0. 04 04. This supports involvement AMELX, located close DXS16, XAI disease process (AIH1) families. Using multipoint linkage analysis, combined maximum lod score two families 7. 30 location AIH1 2 cM distal DXS16. The support interval around location extended 8 cM proximal DXS92, AIH1 location could precisely defined multipoint mapping. Study recombination events indicated AIH1 lies interval DXS143 DXS85. There significant evidence linkage region third family, indicating locus heterogeneity XAI. Further analysis markers long arm X chromosome showed evidence linkage DXS144E F9 recombination either markers. Two-point analysis gave peak lod score DXS144E maximum lod score 2. 83 theta = 0, peak lod score multipoint linkage analysis 2. 84 theta = 0. The support interval extended 9 cM proximal DXS144E 14 cM distal F9. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS). Anonymous marker loci within 400 kb HLA-A generate haplotypes linkage disequilibrium hemochromatosis gene (HFE) The hemochromatosis gene (HFE) maps 6p21. 3 less 1 cM HLA class I genes; however, precise physical location gene remained elusive controversial. The unambiguous identification crossover event within hemochromatosis families difficult; particularly hampered variability phenotypic expression well sex- age-related penetrance disease. For practical considerations, traditional linkage analysis could prove limited value refining extrapolated physical position HFE. We therefore embarked upon linkage-disequilibrium analysis HFE normal chromosomes Brittany population. In present report, 66 hemochromatosis families yielding 151 hemochromatosis chromosomes 182 normal chromosomes RFLP-typed battery probes, including two newly derived polymorphic markers 6. 7 HLA-F loci located 150 250 kb telomeric HLA-A, respectively. The results suggest strong peak existing linkage disequilibrium focused within i82-to-6. 7 interval (approximately 250 kb). The zone linkage disequilibrium flanked i97 locus, positioned 30 kb proximal i82, HLA-F gene, found 250 kb distal HLA-A, markers display significant association HFE. These data support possibility HFE resides within 400-kb expanse DNA i97 HLA-F. Alternatively, tight association HLA-A3 allele 1 6. 7 locus, comprised major ancestral founder HFE haplotype Brittany, supports possibility disease gene may reside immediately telomeric 6. 7 locus within linkage-disequilibrium zone. Additionally, hemochromatosis haplotypes possessing HLA-A11 low-frequency HLA-F polymorphism (allele 2) supportive separate founder chromosome containing second, independently arising mutant allele. Overall, establishment likely " hemochromatosis critical region " centromeric boundary identification linkage-disequilibrium zone significantly contribute reduction amount DNA required searched novel coding sequences constituting HFE defect Natural selection hemi- heterozygotes G6PD deficiency Africa resistance severe malaria. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, common enzymopathy humans, affects 400 million people. The geographical correlation distribution historical endemicity malaria suggests disorder risen frequency natural selection malaria. However, attempts confirm G6PD deficiency protective case-control studies malaria yielded conflicting results. Hence, X-linked disorder, unclear whether male hemizygotes female heterozygotes protected or, frequently suggested, females. Furthermore, much protection may afforded unknown. Here report that, two large case-control studies 2, 000 African children, common African form G6PD deficiency (G6PD A-) associated 46-58% reduction risk severe malaria female heterozygotes male hemizygotes. A mathematical model incorporating measured selective advantage malaria suggests counterbalancing selective disadvantage, associated enzyme deficiency, retarded rise frequency malaria-endemic regions. Although G6PD deficiency regarded generally benign disorder, earlier environmental conditions could significantly disadvantageous.. Prader-Willi syndrome chromosome 15.

The clinical features eight cases 15q11-12 deletion similar originally described PWS. On hand, group normal karyotype patients heterogeneous, features strictly correspond clinical definition PWS. However, hypothesis PWS associated deletion 15q11-12 neither explain apparently balanced translocations chromosome 15 account small supernumerary metacentric chromosomes corresponding isochromosome 15 band 15q11 observed cases.. Molecular basis phenylketonuria related hyperphenylalaninemias: mutations polymorphisms human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. Mutations human phenylalanine hydroxylase gene producing phenylketonuria hyperphenylalaninemia identified many patients various ethnic groups. These mutations exhibit high degree association specific restriction fragment-length polymorphism haplotypes PAH locus. About 50 mutations single-base substitutions, including six nonsense mutations eight splicing mutations, remainder missense mutations. One splicing mutation results 3 amino acid in-frame insertion. Two 3 large deletions, 2 single codon deletions, 2 single base deletions found. Twelve missense mutations apparently result methylation subsequent deamination highly mutagenic CpG dinucleotides. Recurrent mutation observed several sites, producing associations different haplotypes different populations. About half missense mutations examined vitro expression analysis, significant correlation observed residual PAH activity disease phenotype. Since continuing advances molecular methodologies dramatically accelerated rate new mutations identified characterized, register mutations updated periodically.. The intron 7 donor splice site transition: second Tay-Sachs disease mutation French Canada. Mutations hexosaminidase A (HEXA) gene cause Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) elevated frequency Ashkenazi Jewish French-Canadian populations. We report novel TSD allele French-Canadian population associated infantile form disease. The mutation, G-- > A transition + 1 position intron 7, abolishes donor splice site. Cultured human fibroblasts compound heterozygote transition (and deletion mutation) produce detectable HEXA mRNA. The intron 7 + 1 mutation occurs base adjacent site adult-onset TSD mutation (G805A). In mutations restriction site endonuclease EcoRII abolished. Unambiguous diagnosis, therefore, requires allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization distinguish two mutant alleles. The intron 7 + 1 mutation detected three unrelated families. Obligate heterozygotes intron 7 + 1 mutation born Saguenay-Lac-St-Jean region Quebec. The recent ancestors common obligate carriers mutation Charlevoix region province Quebec. This mutation thus different geographic centre diffusion probably less common exon 1 deletion TSD mutation French Canadians. Neither mutation detected France, ancestral homeland French Canada.. Recessively inherited multiple epiphyseal dysplasia normal stature, club foot, double layered patella caused DTDST mutation. We observed 25 different mutations diastrophic dysplasia sulphate transporter gene (DTDST) association recessive disorders achondrogenesis 1B, atelosteogenesis 2, diastrophic dysplasia. The c862t (R279W) transition common mutation non-Finnish patients, disorders usually combined DTDST mutations. We seen case homozygosity c862t (R279W) analysed DNA 36 year old male tall-normal stature (180 cm) asked genetic counselling suspected multiple epiphyseal dysplasia. He treated club foot hip dysplasia birth. Skeletal changes consistent multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, peculiar finding double layered patella, recognised childhood. Cleft palate, swelling ear pinna, hitch hiker thumb absent. He found homozygous, healthy parents heterozygous, R279W mutation DTDST, fibroblasts showed sulphate incorporation defect typical DTDST disorders. Counselling given recessive disorder, thereby considerably reducing probability affected offspring. Multiple epiphyseal dysplasia frequently caused dominant mutations COMP (EDM1, McKusick 132400) COL9A2 genes (EDM2, McKusick 600204). A patients families features similar proband described previously considered autosomal recessive MED (EDM4, McKusick 226900). This observation confirms existence entity assigns phenotypic spectrum associated mutations DTDST locus.. Myotonic dystrophy: size- sex-dependent dynamics CTG meiotic instability, somatic mosaicism. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) progressive neuromuscular disorder results elongations unstable (CTG) n repeat, located 3 untranslated region DM gene. A correlation demonstrated increase repeat number sequence severity disease. However, clinical status patients cannot unambiguously ascertained solely basis number CTG repeats. Moreover, exclusive maternal inheritance congenital form remains unexplained. Our observation differently sized repeats various DM tissues individual may explain size mutation observed lymphocytes necessarily correlate severity nature symptoms. Through molecular genetic study 142 families including 418 DM patients, investigated dynamics CTG repeat meiotic instability. A positive correlation size repeat intergenerational enlargement observed similarly male female meioses < = 0. 5-kb CTG sequences. Beyond 0. 5 kb, intergenerational variation important female meioses, whereas tendency compression observed almost exclusively male meioses, > = 1. 5-kb fragments. This implies size- sex-dependent meiotic instability. Moreover, segregation analysis supports hypothesis maternal well familial predisposition occurrence congenital form. Finally, analysis reveals significant excess transmitting grandfathers partially accounted increased fertility affected males Fatal pyoderma gangrenosum association C7 deficiency. Although pyoderma gangrenosum (PG) often associated systemic diseases, reported association congenital complement deficiencies. We describe aggressive ultimately fatal case PG patient congenital C7 deficiency. Deficiencies C7 associated decreased neutrophil chemotaxis, phagocytosis, opsonization, similar immunologic abnormalities described patients PG. Our patients decreased complement level, directly related development PG, may contributed aggressive nature disease.. Emerin deficiency nuclear membrane patients Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy. Mutations STA gene Xq28 locus found patients X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD). This gene encodes hitherto unknown protein named emerin. To elucidate subcellular localization emerin, raised two antisera synthetic peptide fragments predicted emerin cDNA. Using antisera, found positive nuclear membrane staining skeletal, cardiac smooth muscles normal controls patients neuromuscular diseases EDMD. In contrast, deficiency immunofluorescent staining skeletal cardiac muscle EDMD patients observed. A 34 kD protein immunoreactive antisera--the protein equivalent predicted emerin. Together, findings suggest specific deficiency emerin nuclear membrane muscle cells patients EDMD.. A p16INK4a-insensitive CDK4 mutant targeted cytolytic T lymphocytes human melanoma. A mutated cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) identified tumor-specific antigen recognized HLA-A2. 1-restricted autologous cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTLs) human melanoma. The mutated CDK4 allele present autologous cultured melanoma cells metastasis tissue, patients lymphocytes. The mutation, arginine-to-cysteine exchange residue 24, part CDK4 peptide recognized CTLs prevented binding CDK4 inhibitor p16INK4a, p21 p27KIP1. The mutation found one additional melanoma among 28 melanomas analyzed. These results suggest mutation CDK4 create tumor-specific antigen disrupt cell-cycle regulation exerted tumor suppressor p16INK4a.. Molecular analysis familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus: early diagnosis asymptomatic carrier. Familial neurohypophyseal diabetes insipidus (FNDI) inherited deficiency hormone arginine vasopressin (AVP) transmitted autosomal dominant trait. In present study analyzed AVP-neurophysin II (AVP-NPII) gene Spanish kindred. Studies performed seven members (four clinically affected) family. Patients diagnosed Hospital Universitario Gregorio Maranon (Madrid, Spain). The entire coding region AVP-NPII gene family members amplified PCR sequenced. All affected individuals presented missense mutation (G1757-- > A) replaces glycine position 23 arginine within NPII domain. The substitution confirmed restriction endonuclease analysis present heterozygosis. Additionally, one asymptomatic relatives (a girl 8 months old time study) identified carrier mutation developed disease 3 months later. The alteration found second exon gene family seems responsible disease, individuals harboring mutation previously diagnosed eventually developed FNDI. Identification molecular defect underlying FNDI affected families powerful tool early asymptomatic diagnosis infants.. Sialophorin, surface sialoglycoprotein defective Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, involved human T lymphocyte proliferation. The mAb L10 used determine distribution function sialophorin, heavily glycosylated surface molecule deficient/defective lymphocytes patients X-linked immunodeficiency Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Dual-parameter FACS analysis indicated sialophorin expressed CD4 + CD8 + lymphocytes, subpopulation peripheral blood B lymphocytes, thymocytes, subpopulation bone marrow cells. Functional studies demonstrated L10 mAb stimulates proliferation peripheral blood T lymphocytes measured stimulation [3H] thymidine incorporation. The time course magnitude increased [3H] thymidine incorporation T lymphocytes response L10 mAb paralleled induced anti-CD3 mAb. Effective stimulation dependent presence monocytes Fc portion L10 mAb. Stimulation lymphocytes L10, like stimulation anti-CD3 mAb, involves increased expression 4F2, HLA-DR, IL-2-R. These observations suggest sialophorin functions T cell activation.. Characterization rat spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 gene. Machado-Joseph disease (MJD) belongs group clinically genetically heterogeneous neurodegenerative disorders characterized progressive cerebellar ataxia. The disease-causing mutation recently identified unstable expanded (CAG) n trinucleotide repeat novel gene unknown function. In Caucasians, repeat expansions MJD1 gene also found patients clinically distinct autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3). In order gain insight biology MJD1/SCA3 gene cloned rat homologue studied expression. The rat human ataxin-3 genes highly homologous overall sequence identity approximately 88%. However, C-terminal end putative protein differs strongly published human sequence. The (CAG) n block rat cDNA consists three interrupted units suggesting long polyglutamine stretch essential normal function ataxin-3 protein rodents. The expression pattern SCA3 gene various rat human tissues investigated Northern blot analyses. The mature transcript approximately 6 kb length. In rat testis, smaller transcript 1. 3 kb identified. Transcription rsca3 detected rat tissues including brain. Analyzing expression level SCA3 gene several human brain sections revealed significant higher mRNA level regions predominantly affected MJD. Thus additional molecules and/or regulatory events necessary explain exclusive degeneration certain brain areas. The alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma PAX3/FKHR fusion protein transcriptional activator. Chimeric transcription factors, created gene fusions result chromosomal translocations, implicated pathogenesis several pathologically disparate solid tumors. The PAX3/FKHR fusion gene, formed (2; 13) (q35; q14) alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, encodes hybrid protein contains PAX3 DNA binding domains, paired box homeodomain, linked bisected DNA binding domain FKHR, member forkhead family transcription factors. Here report PAX3 PAX3/FKHR display similar, identical transactivation activities tested model Pax recognition sequences. No functional role could ascribed solely residual FKHR binding domain present fusion protein, FKHR found contribute strong carboxyl terminal activation domain replacing one located unrearranged PAX3 gene. We show native PAX3/FKHR protein present tumor cells translocation transcriptional characteristics similar vitro expressed protein. The ability PAX3/FKHR hybrid protein bind DNA sequence specific manner transactivate expression artificial reporter genes suggests aberrant expression could subvert transcriptional programs normally control growth, differentiation, survival primitive myogenic precursors vivo.. Myotonia levior chloride channel disorder. The group dominant non-dystrophic myotonias, comprising disorders characterized clinically similar forms myogenic muscle stiffness, genetically inhomogeneous. Dominant myotonia congenita (Thomsens disease) linked CLCN1, gene encoding major muscle chloride channel, localized chromosome 7q35. In contrast, dominant myotonias sensitive potassium caused point mutations SCN4A chromosome 17q, gene alpha subunit adult skeletal muscle sodium channel. No linkage molecular genetic data yet available myotonia levior characterized milder symptoms later onset myotonia Thomsens disease, absence muscle hypertrophy. We report CLCN1 Gln-552-Arg substitution family dominant inheritance previously diagnosed myotonia levior. Thus, disorder appears variant Thomsens disease due mutations leading low clinical expressivity. In addition, report novel Ile-290-Met CLCN1 mutation typical Thomsen pedigree. In another family previously diagnosed Thomsens disease, unexpectedly found CLCN1 14 bp deletion known cause recessive myotonia, rare Trp-118-Gly polymorphism.. Markedly accelerated catabolism apolipoprotein A-II (ApoA-II) high density lipoproteins containing ApoA-II classic lecithin: cholesterol acyltransferase deficiency fish-eye disease. Classic (complete) lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) deficiency Fish-eye disease (partial LCAT deficiency) genetic syndromes associated markedly decreased plasma levels high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol increased risk atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. We investigated metabolism HDL apolipoproteins (apo) apoA-I apoA-II total five patients LCAT deficiency, one classic LCAT deficiency four Fish-eye disease. Plasma levels apoA-II decreased proportionately greater extent (23% normal) apoA-I (30% normal). In addition, plasma concentrations HDL particles containing apoA-I apoA-II (LpA-I A-II) much lower (18% normal) particles containing apoA-I (LpA-I) (51% normal). The metabolic basis low levels apoA-II LpA-I A-II investigated five patients using exogenous radiotracer endogenous stable isotope labeling techniques. The mean plasma residence time apoA-I decreased 2. 08 +/- 0. 27 (controls 4. 74 +/- 0. 65 days); however, residence time apoA-II even shorter 1. 66 +/- 0. 24 (controls 5. 25 +/- 0. 61 d). In addition, catabolism apoA-I LpA-I A-II substantially faster apoA-I LpA-I. In summary, genetic syndromes either complete partial LCAT deficiency result low levels HDL preferential hypercatabolism apoA-II HDL particles containing apoA-II. Because LpA-I proposed protective LpA-I A-II atherosclerosis, selective effect metabolism LpA-I A-II may provide potential explanation patients classic LCAT deficiency Fish-eye disease increased risk premature atherosclerosis despite markedly decreased levels HDL cholesterol apoA-I The identical 5' splice-site acceptor mutation five attenuated APC families Newfoundland demonstrates founder effect. Inherited mutations APC gene predispose carriers multiple adenomatous polyps colon rectum colorectal cancer. Mutations located extreme 5 end APC gene, however, associated less severe disease known attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli (AAPC). Many individuals AAPC develop relatively colorectal polyps still high risk colorectal cancer. We report identification 5 APC germline mutation five separately ascertained AAPC families Newfoundland, Canada. This disease-causing mutation single basepair change (G A) splice-acceptor region APC intron 3 creates mutant RNA without exon 4 APC. The observation APC mutation five families geographic area demonstrates founder effect. Furthermore, identification germline mutation strengthens correlation 5 location APC disease-causing mutation attenuated polyposis phenotype.. Linkage aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) marker loci long arm chromosome 4. Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) caused deficient activity enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA). The structural gene AGA assigned region 4q21-qter chromosome 4. We studied map position AGU locus relation marker loci long arm chromosome 4 using linkage analyses. Restriction fragment length polymorphism alleles ADH2, ADH3, EGF, FG alpha FG beta loci blood group antigens MNS locus determined panel 12 Finnish AGU families. The heterozygous family members identified reduced activity AGA lymphocytes. Linkage studies performed using pairwise multipoint analyses. Loose linkage AGU locus FG MNS loci observed (z = 1. 16, z = 1. 39, respectively). Multipoint analysis fixed map [ADH- (0. 03) -EGF- (0. 35) -FG- (0. 11) -MNS] suggests location AGU locus 0. 05-0. 30 recombination units distal MNS (z = 3. 03). The order cen-ADH-EGF-FG-MNS-AGU 35 times likely next best order cen-ADH-EGF-AGU-FG-MNS. Linkage analysis X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy application post- prenatal diagnosis. We performed linkage analysis DNA markers DXS52 clotting factor VIII gene (F8C), several large families X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD). The tight linkage DXS52 could extended giving maximal LOD score 22. 5 1 cM. F8C also tightly linked ALD maximal LOD score 7. 8 without recombination. Multipoint linkage analysis markers DXS304, DXS52, F8C indicated gene ALD F8C distal DXS52. In four patients ALD, major structural rearrangement Xqter region observed; particular, abnormalities vision blindness genes. DNA analysis appeared use determination carrier status females risk, determination origin mutation particular family, prenatal diagnosis. Multicentric origin hemochromatosis gene (HFE) mutations. Genetic hemochromatosis (GH) believed disease restricted European ancestry. In northwestern Europe, > 80% GH patients homozygous one mutation, substitution tyrosine cysteine position 282 (C282Y) unprocessed protein. In proportion GH patients, two mutations present, C282Y H63D. The clinical significance second mutation appears predispose 1% -2% compound heterozygotes expression disease. The distribution two mutations differ, C282Y limited northwestern European ancestry H63D found allele frequencies > 5%, Europe, countries bordering Mediterranean, Middle East, Indian subcontinent. The C282Y mutation occurs haplotype extends </= 6 Mb, suggesting mutation arisen past 2, 000 years. The H63D mutation older occur large extended haplotype, haplotype case extending </= 700 kb. Here report finding H63D C282Y mutations new haplotypes. In Sri Lanka found H63D three new haplotypes found C282Y one new haplotype, demonstrating mutations arisen independently island. These results suggest HFE gene subject selection pressure. These selection pressures could due infectious diseases, environmental conditions, genetic disorders anemia. Identification localization mutations Lesch-Nyhan locus ribonuclease A cleavage. Many mutations leading human disease result single DNA base pair changes cannot identified Southern analysis. This prompted development alternative assays point mutation detection. The recently described ribonuclease A cleavage procedure, polyuridylic acid-paper affinity chromatography step, used identify mutational lesions hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) messenger RNAs patients Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Distinctive ribonuclease A cleavage patterns identified messenger RNA 5 14 Lesch-Nyhan patients chosen HPRT Southern Northern blotting pattern changes found. This approach allows HPRT mutation detection 50 percent cases Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The polyuridylic acid-paper affinity procedure provides general method analysis low abundance messenger RNAs.. MEFV-Gene analysis armenian patients Familial Mediterranean fever: diagnostic value unfavorable renal prognosis M694V homozygous genotype-genetic therapeutic implications. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) recessively inherited disorder common patients Armenian ancestry.

Renal amyloidosis, prevented colchicine, severe complication FMF, disorder associated mutations MEFV gene. To evaluate diagnostic prognostic value MEFV-gene analysis, investigated 90 Armenian FMF patients 77 unrelated families selected genetic-linkage analysis. Eight mutations, one (R408Q) new, found account 93% 163 independent FMF alleles, FMF alleles identified 89% patients. In several instances, family studies provided molecular evidence pseudodominant transmission incomplete penetrance disease phenotype. The M694V homozygous genotype found associated higher prevalence renal amyloidosis arthritis, compared genotypes (P =. 0002 P =. 006, respectively). The demonstration diagnostic prognostic value MEFV analysis particular modes inheritance lead new ways management FMF-including genetic counseling therapeutic decisions affected families. Identification localization huntingtin brain human lymphoblastoid cell lines anti-fusion protein antibodies. The Huntington disease (HD) phenotype associated expansion trinucleotide repeat IT15 gene, predicted encode 348-kDa protein named huntington. We used polyclonal monoclonal anti-fusion protein antibodies identify native huntingtin rat, monkey, human. Western blots revealed protein expected molecular weight present soluble fraction rat monkey brain tissues lymphoblastoid cells control cases. In lymphoblastoid cell lines juvenile-onset heterozygote HD cases, normal mutant huntingtin expressed, increasing repeat expansion leads lower levels mutant protein. Immunocytochemistry indicates huntingtin located neurons throughout brain, highest levels evident larger neurons. In human striatum, huntingtin enriched patch-like distribution, potentially corresponding first areas affected HD. Subcellular localization huntingtin consistent cytosolic protein primarily found somatodendritic regions. Huntingtin appears particularly associate microtubules, although also associated synaptic vesicles. On basis localization huntingtin association microtubules, speculate mutation impairs cytoskeletal anchoring transport mitochondria, vesicles, organelles molecules.. Correlation location germ-line mutations APC gene number colorectal polyps familial adenomatous polyposis patients. Recently isolated adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene causes familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), germ-line mutations substantial number FAP patients identified. On basis information, compared location germ-line mutations APC gene 22 unrelated patients (12 reported previously) number colorectal polyps developed FAP patients; 17 sparse types five profuse types. All one mutations considered cause truncation gene product frame-shift due deletion (14 cases) nonsense mutation (seven cases). The location germ-line mutations seems correlate two clinical types; germ-line mutations five FAP patients profuse polyps observed codon 1250 codon 1464, whereas mutations 17 FAP patients fewer polyps observed regions APC gene. The result suggests number colorectal polyps FAP patients may associated difference stability biological function truncated APC protein.. Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy: correlation phenotype electroretinography sites dystrophin mutations. The dark-adapted electroretinogram (ERG) patients Duchenne Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) shows marked reduction b-wave amplitude. Genotype-phenotype studies mouse models DMD show position-specific effects mutations upon phenotype mice 5 defects dystrophin normal ERGs, defects central region normal b-wave amplitude associated prolonged implicit times b-wave oscillatory potentials, mice 3 defects phenotype similar seen DMD/BMD patients. The mouse studies suggest key role carboxyl terminal dystrophin isoform, Dp260, retinal electrophysiology. We undertaken systematic evaluation DMD/BMD patients clinical examination review literature order determine whether position-specific effects mutations noted mouse present man. We found that, man, wider variation DMD defects correlate reductions b-wave amplitude. Individuals normal ERGs mutations predominantly located 5 transcript initiation site Dp260. Our results suggest important determinant ERG b-wave phenotype mutation position, rather muscle disease severity. Forty-six per cent patients mutations 5 Dp260 transcript start site abnormal ERGs, opposed 94% distal mutations. The human genotype-phenotype correlations consistent role Dp260 normal retinal electrophysiology may also reflect expression C-terminal dystrophin isoforms contributions retinal signal transmission.. Molecular characterization two galactosemia mutations one polymorphism: implications structure-function analysis human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase. We report molecular characterization two galactosemia mutations, L74P F171S, one polymorphism, S135L, human galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT). Both galactosemia mutations result reduced enzymatic activity reconstructed cDNA overexpressed. The polymorphism, contrast, near normal activity. Both mutations affect evolutionarily conserved residues, suggesting functionally important, polymorphism occurs nonconserved domain presumably critical enzymatic function. The F171S mutation close putative active-site nucleophile. Our data support notion molecular heterogeneity galactosemia suggest galactosemia mutations GALT polymorphisms may useful tools highlighting different functional domains human GALT.. Gaucher disease: origins Ashkenazi Jewish N370S 84GG acid beta-glucosidase mutations. Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD), non-neuronopathic lysosomal storage disorder, results deficient activity acid beta-glucosidase (GBA). Type 1 disease panethnic prevalent individuals Ashkenazi Jewish (AJ) descent. Of causative GBA mutations, N370S particularly frequent AJ population, (q approximately. 03), whereas 84GG insertion (q approximately. 003) occurs exclusively Ashkenazim. To investigate genetic history mutations AJ population, short tandem repeat (STR) markers used map 9. 3-cM region containing GBA locus genotype 261 AJ N370S chromosomes, 60 European non-Jewish N370S chromosomes, 62 AJ 84GG chromosomes. A highly conserved haplotype four markers flanking GBA (PKLR, D1S1595, D1S2721, D1S2777) observed AJ chromosomes non-Jewish N370S chromosomes, suggesting occurrence founder common populations. Of note, presence different divergent haplotypes suggested occurrence de novo, recurrent N370S mutations. In contrast, different conserved haplotype markers identified 84GG chromosomes, unique AJ population. On basis linkage disequilibrium (LD) delta values, non-Jewish European N370S chromosomes greater haplotype diversity less LD markers flanking conserved haplotype AJ N370S chromosomes. This finding consistent presence N370S mutation non-Jewish European population prior founding AJ population. Coalescence analyses N370S 84GG mutations estimated similar coalescence times, 48 55.5 generations ago, respectively. The results studies consistent significant bottleneck occurring AJ population first millennium, population became established Europe. Investigation thermoregulatory characteristics patients Prader-Willi syndrome. A survey instrument used assess temperature regulation characteristics children Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) compared 3 control groups sibs PWS patients (SIB), neurodevelopmentally handicapped children (ND), age gender matched well children (WC). Significant differences found PWS patients, SIB controls, WC controls prevalence febrile convulsions, fever-associated symptoms, temperature less 94 degrees F. No differences noted variable PWS patients ND controls, suggesting abnormalities unique PWS, occur neurodevelopmentally handicapped individual, suggesting necessarily reflect syndrome-specific hypothalamic abnormalities.. Abnormal high density lipoproteins cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. The plasma lipoprotein profiles high density lipoproteins (HDL) characterized patients genetic disease cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). Abnormalities HDL may contribute increased atherogenesis excessive deposits tissue sterols presence low low-normal concentrations plasma cholesterol (165 +/- 25 mg/dl) low density lipoproteins (LDL). The mean HDL-cholesterol concentration CTX plasmas 14. 5 +/- 3. 2 mg/dl, one-third normal value. The low HDL-cholesterol reflects low concentration abnormal lipid composition plasma HDL. Relative normal HDL, cholesteryl esters low, free cholesterol phospholipids essentially normal, triglycerides increased. The ratio apoprotein (apo) total cholesterol HDL CTX two three times greater normal. In CTX HDL, ratio apoAI apoAII high, proportion apoC low, normally minor form apoAI increased relative forms. The HDL electron micrographs appeared normal morphologically particle size. The abnormalities lipoprotein distribution profile composition plasma HDL result metabolic defects understood may linked genetic defect bile acid synthesis CTX. As consequence, probable normal functions HDL, possibly including modulation LDL-cholesterol uptake removal excess cholesterol peripheral tissues, perturbed significantly disease. Splicing defects ataxia-telangiectasia gene, ATM: underlying mutations consequences. Mutations resulting defective splicing constitute significant proportion (30/62 [48%]) new series mutations ATM gene patients ataxia-telangiectasia (AT) detected protein-truncation assay followed sequence analysis genomic DNA. Fewer half splicing mutations involved canonical AG splice-acceptor site GT splice-donor site. A higher percentage mutations occurred less stringently conserved sites, including silent mutations last nucleotide exons, mutations nucleotides conserved AG GT consensus splice sites, creation splice-acceptor splice-donor sites either introns exons. These splicing mutations led variety consequences, including exon skipping and, lesser degree, intron retention, activation cryptic splice sites, creation new splice sites. In addition, 5 12 nonsense mutations 1 missense mutation associated deletion cDNA exons mutations occurred. No ATM protein detected western blotting AT cell line splicing mutations identified. Several cases exon skipping normal controls patients underlying defect could found genomic DNA also observed, suggesting caution interpretation exon deletions observed ATM cDNA accompanying identification genomic mutations.. Mutations cathepsin C gene responsible Papillon-Lefevre syndrome. Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) autosomal recessive disorder characterised palmoplantar hyperkeratosis severe early onset periodontitis results premature loss primary secondary dentitions. A major gene locus PLS mapped 2. 8 cM interval chromosome 11q14. Correlation physical genetic maps interval indicate includes least 40 ESTs six known genes including lysosomal protease cathepsin C gene (CTSC). The CTSC message expressed high levels variety immune cells including polymorphonuclear leucocytes, macrophages, precursors. By RT-PCR, found CTSC also expressed epithelial regions commonly affected PLS, including palms, soles, knees, oral keratinised gingiva. The 4. 7 kb CTSC gene consists two exons. Sequence analysis CTSC subjects affected PLS five consanguineous Turkish families identified four different mutations. An exon 1 nonsense mutation (856C-- > T) introduces premature stop codon amino acid 286. Three exon 2 mutations identified, including single nucleotide deletion (2692delA) codon 349 introducing frameshift premature termination codon, 2 bp deletion (2673-2674delCT) results introduction stop codon amino acid 343, G-- > A substitution codon 429 (2931G-- > A) introducing premature termination codon. All PLS patients homozygous cathepsin C mutations inherited common ancestor. Parents sibs heterozygous cathepsin C mutations show either palmoplantar hyperkeratosis severe early onset periodontitis characteristic PLS. A complete understanding functional physiology cathepsin C carries significant implications understanding normal abnormal skin development periodontal disease susceptibility Identification single nucleotide change hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase gene (HPRTYale) responsible Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Complete deficiency hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT) causes Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Previous characterization mutant form HPRT, HPRTYale, subject Lesch-Nyhan syndrome revealed normal mRNA protein concentrations, residual catalytic activity, cathodal migration upon PAGE. We cloned sequenced HPRTYale cDNA. The nucleotide sequence full-length HPRTYale cDNA revealed single nucleotide substitution compared normal HPRT cDNA G----C nucleotide position 211. This transversion predicts substitution arginine glycine amino acid position 71, explaining cathodal migration HPRTYale. Chou-Fasman secondary structure analysis predicts change probability beta-turn formation region containing mutation. Inclusion bulky arginine side chain place glycine probably disrupts protein folding well. Cloning mutant forms cDNA allows identification specific mutations, provides insight mutational mechanisms, facilitates structure-function analysis mutant proteins.. Molecular detection chromosomal translocations disrupt putative retinoblastoma susceptibility locus. A candidate DNA sequence many properties predicted retinoblastoma susceptibility (RB1) locus cloned (S. H. Friend, R. Bernards, S. Rogelj, R. A. Weinberg, J. M. Rapaport, D. M. Albert, T. P. Dryja, Nature [London] 323 643-645, 1986). The large size gene (ca. 200 kilobases [kb]) multiple dispersed exons (Wiggs et al., N. Engl. J. Med. 318 151-157, 1988) complicate molecular screening strategies important prenatal presymptomatic diagnosis carrier detection. Here used field inversion gel electrophoresis (FIGE) construct restriction map approximately 1, 000 kb DNA surrounding RB1 locus detect translocation breakpoints three retinoblastoma patients. DNA probes either 5 3 end gene used detect 250-kb EagI restriction fragment DNA unaffected individuals. Both probes identified additional hybridizing fragment DNA patient, permitting breakpoints three mapped within cloned RB1 gene. Analysis breakpoint one translocation cell line allowed RB1 gene oriented 5 end toward centromere. The 5 end gene also appeared associated clustering sites several infrequently cleaving restriction enzymes, indicating presence HpaII tiny fragment island. The detection mapping translocation breakpoints three retinoblastoma patients within putative RB1 gene substantiated authenticity candidate sequence demonstrated utility FIGE detecting chromosomal rearrangements affecting locus. Constitutional mutations WT1 gene patients Denys-Drash syndrome. The Denys-Drash syndrome characterised typical nephropathy, genital abnormalities also predisposes development Wilms tumor. These patients eventually go end stage renal failure. A candidate Wilms tumor gene, WT1, 11p13 chromosome region recently cloned. We analysed DNA sequence constitutional cells eight patients shown heterozygous mutations six them. Four mutations exon 9, resulting missense mutations. Three nucleotide position 1180 resulting arg > trp amino acid change. The position 1186 converting asp > asn predicted resultant protein. One patient missense mutation exon 8, converting arg > his. A single base pair insertion nucleotide position 821 exon 6 resulted generation premature stop codon last patient. We unable find mutation one patient despite complete sequencing genomic sequence gene. The last patient carried constitutional deletion 11p13 region additional mutation found. There obvious correlation type mutation phenotypic expression. These results demonstrate WT1 gene important development kidney genito-urinary system.. Four novel PEPD alleles causing prolidase deficiency. Mutations PEPD locus cause prolidase deficiency (McKusick 170100), rare autosomal recessive disorder characterized iminodipeptiduria, skin ulcers, mental retardation, recurrent infections. Four PEPD mutations five severely affected individuals characterized analysis reverse-transcribed, PCR-amplified (RT-PCR) cDNA. We used SSCP analysis four overlapping cDNA fragments covering entire coding region PEPD gene detected abnormal SSCP bands fragment spanning part exons 13-15 three probands. Direct sequencing mutant cDNAs showed G-- > A, 1342 substitution (G448R) two patients 3-bp deletion (delta E452 delta E453) another. In two probands amplified products reduced size. Direct sequencing mutant cDNAs revealed deletion exon 5 one patient exon 7 other. Intronic sequences flanking exons 5 7 identified using inverse PCR followed direct sequencing. Conventional PCR direct sequencing established intron-exon borders mutant genomic DNA revealing two splice acceptor mutations G-- > C substitution position -1 intron 4 A-- > G substitution position -2 intron 6. Our results indicate severe form prolidase deficiency caused multiple PEPD alleles. In report attempt begin process describing alleles cataloging phenotypic expression.. Translocation t(5;11)(q13.1;p13) associated familial isolated aniridia. A father daughter isolated aniridia observed apparently balanced, reciprocal translocation involving chromosomes 5 11 [t (5; 11) (q13. 1; p13)]. No clinical characteristics often associated deletion 11p13 observed family. This finding, association 3 instances single breaks 11p13 aniridia, supports assignment AN2 11p13. Genotype-phenotype analysis X-linked Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy identification missense mutation associated milder phenotype. Direct sequencing emerin gene 22 families Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EMD) revealed mutations 21 (95%), confirming emerin mutations identified majority families X-linked EMD. Most emerin mutations result absence protein. In study three mutations (a missense mutation Pro183Thr two in-frame deletions removing residues 95-99 236-241, respectively) unusual associated expression mutant protein. The phenotype families compared detail clinical features cases typical null mutations. For in-frame deletions significant differences. In family missense mutation phenotype milder. Age onset later first symptoms development ankle contractures muscle weakness. These findings diagnostic implications well pointing functionally important regions emerin protein.. Asef, link tumor suppressor APC G-protein signaling. The adenomatous polyposis coli gene (APC) mutated familial adenomatous polyposis sporadic colorectal tumors. Here APC gene product shown bind armadillo repeat domain Rac-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), termed Asef. Endogenous APC colocalized Asef mouse colon epithelial cells neuronal cells. Furthermore, APC enhanced GEF activity Asef stimulated Asef-mediated cell flattening, membrane ruffling, lamellipodia formation MDCK cells. These results suggest APC-Asef complex may regulate actin cytoskeletal network, cell morphology migration, neuronal function.. Localization region homologous Duchenne muscular dystrophy locus mouse X chromosome. Recent progress resulted part gene mutated Duchenne milder Becker muscular dystrophies cloned suggested gene extends 1, 000 2, 000 kilobases (kb). To study mutations gene affect muscle development integrity, would interest available mouse model human disease. The mouse mdx mutation affects muscle confers mild dystrophic syndrome, clear whether mutation equivalent Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy man. Here describe use two sequences human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene cross-hybridize mouse X-linked sequences localize gene homologous DMD mouse. Both sequences map region 10 centimorgan lying Tabby (Ta) St14-1 (DxPas8) loci, close phosphorylase b kinase locus (Phk). By analogy human X-chromosome, conclude region mouse around G6pd St14-1 loci may contain two genes corresponding distinct human myopathies Emery Dreifuss muscular dystrophy known closely linked St14-1 man DMD homologue described here.. Molecular basis hexosaminidase A deficiency pseudodeficiency Berks County Pennsylvania Dutch. Following birth two infants Tay-Sachs disease (TSD), non-Jewish, Pennsylvania Dutch kindred screened TSD carriers using biochemical assay. A high frequency individuals appeared TSD heterozygotes detected (Kelly et al., 1975). Clinical biochemical evidence suggested increased carrier frequency due least two altered alleles hexosaminidase A alpha-subunit. We report two mutant alleles Pennsylvania Dutch kindred, one polymorphism. One allele, reported originally French TSD patient (Akli et al., 1991), GT-- > AT transition donor splice-site intron 9. The second, C-- > T transition nucleotide 739 (Arg247Trp), shown Triggs-Raine et al. (1992) clinically benign " pseudodeficient " allele associated reduced enzyme activity artificial substrate. Finally, polymorphism [G-- > A (759)], leaves valine codon 253 unchanged, described . Gene transfer expression human phenylalanine hydroxylase. Phenylketonuria (PKU) caused genetic deficiency enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). A full-length complementary DNA clone human PAH inserted eukaryotic expression vector transferred mouse NIH3T3 cells normally express PAH. The transformed mouse cells expressed PAH messenger RNA, immunoreactive protein, enzymatic activity characteristic normal human liver products, demonstrating single gene contains necessary genetic information code functional PAH. These results support use human PAH probe prenatal diagnosis detection carriers, provide new opportunities biochemical characterization normal mutant enzymes, investigation alternative genetic therapies PKU.. Macular dystrophy associated mutations codon 172 human retinal degeneration slow gene. BACKGROUND Recently, mutations retinal degeneration slow (rds) gene codes peripherin-rds implicated cause autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. Because gene expressed rods cones, mutations rds gene might expected cause degeneration affecting either scotopic photopic systems. Mutations codon 172 rds gene identified three families autosomal dominantly inherited, progressive macular dystrophy. METHODS Affected individuals underwent ophthalmic examination, scotopic perimetry, dark adaptometry, measurement color-contrast sensitivity, electroretinography characterize photoreceptor dysfunction. RESULTS In one affected member, symptoms progressive central visual loss developed third fourth decade life accompanied central scotoma well-demarcated atrophy retinal pigment epithelium choriocapillaris macula. In general, cone rod thresholds elevated, color-contrast sensitivity absent central visual field. Peripherally, scotopic sensitivities normal, recovery bleach. Cone electroretinograms diminished amplitude, delayed affected adults except one. Rod electroretinograms normal near normal amplitude, normal implicit times. Affected asymptomatic children macular changes, abnormal color-contrast sensitivity, reduced pattern cone electroretinograms. CONCLUSION These results indicate mutations rds gene expressed macular dystrophy, evidence primary cone dysfunction preservation peripheral rod function.. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants: Gd (+) Alexandra associated neonatal jaundice Gd (-) Camperdown young man lamellar cataracts. Two male subjects described, unusual clinical presentations hitherto undescribed G6PD variants. The first, Italian extraction, suffered severe neonatal jaundice following maternal ingestion fresh broad beans (Vicia fava) prenatally postnatally expression enzymatic defect much severe neonatal period retesting adolescence, biochemical characterization showed unique features justify designation new variant Gd (+) Alexandra. The second patient, boy Maltese extraction found bilateral lamellar cataracts age 4 years, identified G6PD deficient result survey children Mediterranean origin unexplained cataract formation; approximately 15% normal enzyme activity, another unique combination biochemical characteristics led designation Gd (-) Camperdown. Although association may coincidental, prompts attention possibility certain circumstances G6PD deficiency may favor cataract formation. The two cases illustrate value characterization mutant enzyme whenever unexpected clinical laboratory results obtained.. DNA restriction fragments associated alpha 1-antitrypsin indicate single origin deficiency allele PI Z. The alpha 1-protease inhibitor, alpha-antitrypsin (AAT), major plasma inhibitor leukocyte elastase bacterial proteases, encoded PI locus chromosome 14 (14q24. 3-q32. 1). A deficiency AAT individuals homozygous PI Z allele occurs 1 2, 000-8, 000 caucasians associated increased risk early adult onset emphysema liver disease childhood. We used DNA polymorphisms associated AAT gene investigate origin PI Z allele. Using two genomic probes extending 5 3 flanking regions, respectively, identified eight polymorphic restriction sites. Extensive linkage disequilibrium occurs throughout probed region PI Z allele, normal PI M alleles. The Z allele occurs mainly one haplotype, indicating single, relatively recent, origin caucasians Myotonic dystrophy transgenic mice expressing expanded CUG repeat. Myotonic dystrophy (DM), common form muscular dystrophy adult humans, results expansion CTG repeat 3 untranslated region DMPK gene. The mutant DMPK messenger RNA (mRNA) contains expanded CUG repeat retained nucleus. We expressed untranslated CUG repeat unrelated mRNA transgenic mice. Mice expressed expanded CUG repeats developed myotonia myopathy, whereas mice expressing nonexpanded repeat not. Thus, transcripts expanded CUG repeats sufficient generate DM phenotype. This result supports role RNA gain function disease pathogenesis.. Submicroscopic deletion cousins Prader-Willi syndrome causes grandmatrilineal inheritance pattern: effects imprinting. The Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) critical region 15q11-q13 subject imprinting. PWS becomes apparent genes paternally inherited chromosome expressed. Familial PWS rare. We report family male female paternal first cousin PWS cytogenetically normal karyotypes. Fluorescence situ hybridization (FISH) analysis shows submicroscopic deletion SNRPN, closely associated loci D15S10, D15S11, D15S63, GABRB3. The cousins fathers two paternal aunts deletion clinically normal. The grandmother cousins deceased available study, grandfather deleted SNRPN. DNA methylation analysis D15S63 consistent abnormality imprinting center associated PWS. " Grandmatrilineal " inheritance occurs woman deletion imprinted, paternally expressed gene risk affected grandchildren sons. In case, PWS become evident long deletion passed matrilineal line. This represents unique inheritance pattern due imprinting.. Expression imprinting MAGEL2 suggest role Prader-willi syndrome homologous murine imprinting phenotype. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) caused loss expression imprinted genes chromosome 15q11-q13. Affected individuals exhibit neonatal hypotonia, developmental delay childhood-onset obesity. Necdin, protein implicated terminal differentiation neurons, PWS candidate gene reduce viability disrupted mouse model. In study, characterized MAGEL2 (also known NDNL1), gene 51% amino acid sequence similarity necdin located 41 kb distal NDN PWS deletion region. MAGEL2 expressed predominantly brain, primary tissue affected PWS several fetal tissues shown northern blot analysis. MAGEL2 imprinted monoallelic expression control brain, paternal-only expression central nervous system demonstrated lack expression brain PWS-affected individual. The orthologous mouse gene (Magel2) located within 150 kb NDN , imprinted paternal-only expression expressed predominantly late developmental stages adult brain shown northern blotting, RT-PCR whole-mount RNA situ hybridization. Magel2 distribution partially overlaps NDN , strong expression detected central nervous system mid-gestation mouse embryos situ hybridization. We hypothesize that, although loss necdin expression may important neonatal presentation PWS, loss MAGEL2 may critical abnormalities brain development dysmorphic features individuals PWS.. A single origin phenylketonuria Yemenite Jews. Phenylketonuria (PKU) metabolic disease caused recessive mutations gene encoding hepatic enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The incidence PKU varies widely across different geographic areas, highest (about 1 5, 000 live births) Ireland western Scotland, among Yemenite Jews. A limited number point mutations account PKU cases European population. Here report single molecular defect--a deletion spanning third exon PAH gene--is responsible PKU cases among Yemenite Jews. Examination random sample Yemenite Jews using molecular probe detects carriers deletion indicated high frequency defective gene community. Although deleted PAH gene traced 25 different locations throughout Yemen, family histories official documents Yemenite Jewish community showed common ancestor carriers genetic defect lived Sana, capital Yemen, eighteenth century.. High resolution genetic analysis suggests one ancestral predisposing haplotype origin myotonic dystrophy mutation. The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy (DM) identified amplification unstable trinucleotide (CTG) n repeat 99% global DM population. It complete linkage disequilibrium Alu element polymorphism within DM kinase gene, suggesting DM consequence one ancestral mutations. A recent analysis utilizing polymorphism well flanking dinucleotide marker, suggested similar Fragile X syndrome, DM exhibited founder effect (Imbert et al., 1993 Nature Genet. 4, 72-76). In contrast, low reproductive fitness individuals congenital DM (the endpoint genetic anticipation myotonic dystrophy) suggests higher rate new mutations. We present high resolution genetic analysis DM locus using PCR based assays nine polymorphisms, spanning physical distance 30 kb, within immediately flanking DM kinase gene. The persistent complete allelic association DM mutation polymorphisms provides support previous observations suggests strongly DM mutation occurred background particular haplotype (CTG) n repeat became inherently unstable therefore predisposed amplification. Identification rapid detection three Tay-Sachs mutations Moroccan Jewish population. Infantile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) caused mutations HEXA gene result complete absence beta-hexosaminidase A activity. It well known elevated frequency TSD mutations exists among Ashkenazi Jews. More recently become apparent elevated carrier frequencies TSD also occur several ethnic groups, including Moroccan Jews, subgroup Sephardic Jews. Elsewhere reported in-frame deletion one two adjacent phenylalanine codons position 304 305 (delta F304/305) one HEXA allele Moroccan Jewish TSD patient three obligate carriers six unrelated Moroccan Jewish families. We identified two additional mutations within exon 5 HEXA gene account remaining TSD alleles patient carriers. One mutations novel C-to-G transversion, resulting replacement Tyr180 stop codon. The mutation G-to-A transition resulting Arg170-to-Gln substitution. This mutation CpG site Japanese infant Tay-Sachs disease described elsewhere. Analysis nine obligate carriers seven unrelated families showed four harbor delta F304/305 mutation, two Arg170----Gln mutation, one Tyr180----Stop mutation. We also developed rapid, nonradioactive assays detection mutation, helpful carrier screening.. Mapping mouse homologue Wilson disease gene mouse chromosome 8. ATP7B, gene altered Wilson disease (WD) patients, lies block homology shared human chromosome 13q14 central region mouse chromosome 14. However, mapped murine homologue ATP7B (Atp7b) mouse chromosome 8 somatic cell hybrid analysis. Analysis 80 interspecific backcross offspring used position Atp7b close D8Mit3 another ATPase locus, Atp4b, mouse chromosome 8. ATP4B lies 13q34 separated ATP7B several loci whose mouse homologues map mouse chromosome 14. The assignment Atp7b mouse chromosome 8 identifies previously unrecognized region homology chromosome human chromosome 13. This assignment suggests possible location toxic milk mutation mouse, proposed homologue WD.. Characteristics intergenerational contractions CTG repeat myotonic dystrophy. In myotonic dystrophy (DM), size CTG repeat DM kinase gene generally increases successive generations clinical evidence anticipation. However, also cases intergenerational contraction repeat. We examined 1, 489 DM parent-offspring pairs, 95 (6. 4%) showed contractions peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL). In 56 95 pairs, clinical data allowed analysis anticipation status. It surprising anticipation occurred 27 (48%) 56 pairs, none clearly showed later onset DM symptomatic offspring. The contraction occurred 76 (10%) 753 paternal transmissions 19 (3%) 736 maternal transmissions. Anticipation observed frequently maternal (85%) paternal (37%) transmissions (P <. 001). The parental repeat size correlated size intergenerational contraction (r2 =. 50, P < <. 001), slope linear regression steeper paternal (-. 62) maternal (-. 30) transmissions (P < <. 001). Sixteen DM parents multiple DM offspring CTG repeat contractions. This frequency higher frequency expected probability repeat contractions (6. 4%) size DM sib population (1. 54 DM offspring per DM parent, 968 DM parents). We conclude (1) intergenerational contractions CTG repeat leukocyte DNA frequently accompanies apparent anticipation, especially DM maternally transmitted, (2) paternal origin repeat presence repeat contraction sibling increase probability CTG repeat contraction Splice-site mutation PDS gene may result intrafamilial variability deafness Pendred syndrome. Pendred syndrome recessive inherited disorder consists developmental abnormalities cochlea, sensorineural hearing loss, diffuse thyroid enlargement (goiter). This disorder may account 10% cases hereditary deafness. The disease gene (PDS) mapped chromosome 7q22-q31, encodes chloride-iodide transport protein. We performed mutation analysis individual exons PDS gene one Spanish family shows intrafamilial variability deafness phenotype (two patients profound one moderate-severe deafness). We identified new splice-site mutation affecting intron 4 PDS gene, nucleotide position 639 + 7. RNA analysis lymphocytes affected patients showed mutation 639 + 7A-- > G generates new donor splice site, leading mRNA insertion six nucleotides intron 4 PDS. Since newly created donor splice site likely compete normal one, variations levels normal aberrant transcripts PDS gene cochlea may explain variability deafness presentation.. Heterozygous loss Six5 mice sufficient cause ocular cataracts. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) autosomal dominant disorder characterized skeletal muscle wasting, myotonia, cardiac arrhythmia, hyperinsulinaemia, mental retardation ocular cataracts. The genetic defect DM CTG repeat expansion located 3 untranslated region DMPK 5 homeodomain-encoding gene, SIX5 (formerly DMAHP; refs 2-5). There three mechanisms CTG expansion result DM. First, repeat expansion may alter processing transport mutant DMPK mRNA consequently reduce DMPK levels. Second, CTG expansion may establish region heterochromatin 3 repeat sequence decrease SIX5 transcription. Third, toxic effects repeat expansion may intrinsic repeated elements level DNA RNA (refs 10, 11). Previous studies demonstrated dose-dependent loss Dm15 (the mouse DMPK homologue) mice produces partial DM phenotype characterized decreased development skeletal muscle force cardiac conduction disorders. To test role Six5 loss DM, analysed strain mice Six5 deleted. Our results demonstrate rate severity cataract formation inversely related Six5 dosage temporally progressive. Six5 +/- Six5-/- mice show increased steady-state levels Na +/K + -ATPase alpha-1 subunit decreased Dm15 mRNA levels. Thus, altered ion homeostasis within lens may contribute cataract formation. As ocular cataracts characteristic feature DM, results demonstrate decreased SIX5 transcription important aetiology DM. Our data support hypothesis DM contiguous gene syndrome associated partial loss DMPK SIX5.. Cis trans effects myotonic dystrophy (DM) mutation cell culture model. The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy (DM) identified CTG expansion 3-untranslated region (3-UTR) DM protein kinase gene (DMPK), mechanism (s) pathogenesis remain unknown. Studies using DM patient materials often produced confusing results. Therefore, study effects DM mutation controlled environment, established cell culture model system using C2C12 mouse myoblasts. By expressing chimeric reporter constructs containing reporter gene fused human DMPK 3-UTR, identified cis trans effects mediated DM mutation. Our data show mutant DMPK 3-UTR, 57 CTGs, negative cis effect protein expression resulted aggregation reporter transcripts discrete nuclear foci. We determined deletion analysis expanded (CTG) (n) tract alone sufficient mediate cis effects. Furthermore, contrast normal DMPK 3-UTR mRNA, mutant DMPK 3-UTR mRNA (CUG) (200) selectively inhibited myogenic differentiation C2C12 myoblasts. Genetic analysis Cre- loxP system used clearly demonstrate myoblast fusion defect could rescued eliminating expression mutant DMPK 3-UTR transcript. Characterization spontaneous deletion events mapped inhibitory effect (CTG) (n) expansion and/or 3 end DMPK 3-UTR. These results provide evidence DM mutation acts cis reduce protein production (consistent DMPK haploinsufficiency) trans riboregulator inhibit myogenesis.. Intelligence quotient profile myotonic dystrophy, intergenerational deficit, correlation CTG amplification. An abbreviated Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale Revised (WAIS-R) used assess verbal arithmetical cognitive performance 55 subjects myotonic dystrophy (DM), covering grades disease severity, 31 controls 50% risk inheriting DM. Scaled scores assessment converted intelligence quotient (IQ) estimation person. Significant IQ differences found (1) 55 DM subjects (mean 90. 2, SD 16. 1) 31 controls (102. 6, SD 9. 4), sex differences either group; (2) 15 affected parents (99. 3, SD 12. 2) affected children (88. 1, SD 17. 2), significance dependent parental sex female; (3) 15 pairs affected sibs (89. 6, SD 13. 2) normal sibs (100. 2, SD 7. 6). IQ steadily declined (1) age onset signs symptoms decreased, (2) CTG expansion size increased. The correlation appeared linear age onset. The correlation IQ difference CTG expansion difference DM parent-child pairs normal sib-affected sib pairs poor, indicating CTG expansion reliable predictor IQ either individual persons families. Further analysis cognitive function DM required clarify specific deficits characteristic patient group Complement factor 2 deficiency: clinical serological family study. Inherited complement deficiencies associated variety connective tissue diseases. A family inherited deficiency complement factor 2 (C2) described two family members homozygous C2 deficiency developed cutaneous vasculitis sicca syndrome. The family members heterozygous C2 deficiency member HLA-A25, B18, DR2 (w15) haplotype. The mother seropositive rheumatoid arthritis. Further studies showed presence cryoglobulins, antibodies endothelial cells, anticardiolipin antibodies.. Oncogenic point mutations exon 20 RB1 gene families showing incomplete penetrance mild expression retinoblastoma phenotype. The retinoblastoma-predisposition gene, RB1, segregates autosomal dominant trait high (90%) penetrance. Certain families, however, show unusual low-penetrance phenotype many individuals unaffected, unilaterally affected, evidence spontaneously regressed tumors. We used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis PCR sequencing study two families. Mutations found exon 20 RB1 cases. In one family C----T transition codon 661 converts arginine (CGG) tryptophan (TGG) codon. In family, incomplete penetrance mild phenotypic expression observed virtually patients, possibly indicating single amino acid changes may modify protein structure/function tumorigenesis inevitable. In second family mutation codon 675 G----T transversion converts glutamine (GAA) stop (TAA) codon. However, mutation also occurs near potential cryptic splice acceptor site, raising possibility alternative splicing resulting less severely disrupted protein.. Identification novel R21X mutation liver-type arginase gene (ARG1) four Portuguese patients argininemia. Argininemia rare autossomal recessive disorder caused deficiency cytosolic liver-type arginase enzyme (L-arginine urea-hydrolase; E. C. 3. 5. 3. 1). In order investigate molecular basis argininemia four unrelated Portuguese patients (two northern Portugal two Madeira Island) performed DNA sequence analysis exons exon/intron boundaries liver-type arginase gene (ARG1). All patients found homozygous newly identified C - > T transition codon 21 (exon 2) substituting arginine premature stop codon (R21X CGA TGA) generating NlaIII restriction site. Restriction digestion following PCR amplification ARG1 exon 2 confirmed presence mutation. A mutation pleckstrin homology (PH) domain FGD1 gene Italian family faciogenital dysplasia (Aarskog-Scott syndrome). Aarskog-Scott Syndrome (AAS) X-linked disorder characterised short stature multiple facial, limb genital abnormalities. A gene, FGD1, altered patient AAS phenotype, identified found encode protein homology Rho/Rac guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Rho/Rac GEF). However, since original report identification mutated FGD1 gene AAS patient, additional mutations FGD1 gene described. We analysed 13 independent patients clinical diagnosis AAS. One patient presented mutation results nucleotide change exon 10 FGD1 gene (G2559 > A) substituting Gln Arg position 610. The mutation found segregate AAS phenotype affected males carrier females family patient. Interestingly, Arg-610 located within one two pleckstrin homology (PH) domains FGD1 gene corresponds highly conserved residue involved InsP binding PH domains proteins. The residue often mutated Brutons tyrosine kinase (Btk) gene patients X-linked agammaglobulinemia. The Arg610Gln mutation represents first case mutation PH domain FGD1 gene additional evidence mutations PH domains associated human diseases.. Localization histidase human chromosome region 12q22----q24.1 mouse chromosome region 10C2----D1. The human gene histidase (histidine ammonia-lyase; HAL), enzyme deficient histidinemia, assigned human chromosome 12 Southern blot analysis human X mouse somatic cell hybrid DNA. The gene sublocalized region 12q22----q24. 1 situ hybridization, using human histidase cDNA. The homologous locus mouse (Hal) mapped region 10C2----D1 situ hybridization, using cell line mouse homozygous 1. 10 Robertsonian translocation. These assignments extend conserved syntenic region human chromosome 12 mouse chromosome 10 includes genes phenylalanine hydroxylase, gamma interferon, peptidase, citrate synthase. The localization histidase mouse chromosome 10 suggests histidase regulatory locus (Hsd) histidinemia mutation (his), known chromosome 10, may alleles histidase structural gene locus. Noninvasive test fragile X syndrome, using hair root analysis. Identification FMR1 gene repeat-amplification mechanism causing fragile X syndrome led development reliable DNA-based diagnostic methods, including Southern blot hybridization PCR. Both methods performed DNA isolated peripheral blood cells measure repeat size FMR1. Using immunocytochemical technique blood smears, recently developed novel test identification patients fragile X syndrome. This method, also called " antibody test, " uses monoclonal antibodies FMR1 gene product (FMRP) based absence FMRP patients cells. Here describe new diagnostic test identify male patients fragile X syndrome, basis lack FMRP hair roots. Expression FMRP hair roots studied use FMRP-specific antibody test, percentage FMRP-expressing hair roots controls male fragile X patients determined. Control individuals showed clear expression FMRP nearly every hair root, whereas male fragile X patients lacked expression FMRP almost hair roots. Mentally retarded female patients full mutation showed FMRP expression hair roots (< 55%), overlap normal female controls observed. The advantages test (1) plucking hair follicles appreciable harm mentally retarded patient, (2) hairs sent simple envelope diagnostic center, (3) result test available within 5 h plucking. In addition, test enabled us identify two fragile X patients show full mutation analysis DNA isolated blood cells.. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease: detection mutations Thr181----Pro Leu223----Pro proteolipid protein gene, prenatal diagnosis. A family apparent history X-linked Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease presented genetic counseling, requesting carrier detection prenatal diagnosis. RFLP analysis using proteolipid protein (PLP) gene probe uninformative family. A prenatal diagnosis chorionic villus sample (CVS) carried using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis variant exon 4 PLP gene. The fetus predicted unaffected. Sequencing exon CVS, predicted-carrier mother, obligate-carrier grandmother revealed A-to-C change nucleotide 541 two women fetus. As change results Thr-to-Pro change amino acid 181 region gene predicted part transmembrane segment, concluded mutation causing disease family. In addition, second family, exon 5 variant band pattern SSCP analysis shown sequencing due T-to-C change nucleotide 668. This results Leu-to-Pro change carrier mother two affected sons. These results provide examples mutations PLP cause Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease illustrate value SSCP genetic analysis.. A normal male inherited deletion one exon within DMD gene. We describe two brothers identical inherited deletions one single exon within middle DMD gene; one brother Becker muscular dystrophy diagnosed 11 years age, whereas older brother normal 18. These results implications genetic counselling prenatal diagnosis families Becker muscular dystrophy.. Small deletions type II collagen triple helix produce kniest dysplasia. Kniest dysplasia moderately severe type II collagenopathy, characterized short trunk limbs, kyphoscoliosis, midface hypoplasia, severe myopia, hearing loss. Mutations gene encodes type II collagen (COL2A1), predominant protein cartilage, identified number individuals Kniest dysplasia. All two previously described mutations cause in-frame deletions type II collagen, either small deletions gene splice site alterations. Furthermore, one mutations located exons 12 24 COL2A1 gene. We used heteroduplex analysis identify sequence anomalies five individuals Kniest dysplasia. Sequencing index patients genomic DNA identified four new dominant mutations COL2A1 result Kniest dysplasia 21-bp deletion exon 16, 18-bp deletion exon 19, 4-bp deletions splice donor sites introns 14 20. A previously described 28-bp deletion COL2A1 exon 12-intron 12 junction, deleting splice donor site, identified fifth case. The latter three mutations predicted result exon skipping mRNA encoded mutant allele. These data suggest Kniest dysplasia results shorter type II collagen monomers, support hypothesis alteration specific COL2A1 domain, may span exons 12 24, leads Kniest dysplasia phenotype.. Adenomatous polyposis coli cytogenetic deletion chromosome 5 resulting maternal intrachromosomal insertion. We present clinical laboratory findings institutionalised adult patient originally referred autism. A high risk colorectal cancer predicted interstitial deletion long arm chromosome 5, del (5) (q15q22. 3), detected lymphocytes deletion MCC APC genes confirmed molecular analysis. Adenomatous polyposis coli carcinoma rectum subsequently diagnosed patient. She profoundly mentally retarded, autistic, minor dysmorphic features consistent previous patients similar deletions. The deletion arose result recombination within small insertion loop formed meiosis direct insertion (dir ins (5) (q22. 3q14. 2q15)) found patients mother. This family confirms cytogenetic mapping MCC APC genes 5q22 comparison recent cases suggests genes closely linked markers lie within 5q22. 1 subband Somatic mutations APC gene colorectal tumors: mutation cluster region APC gene. We examined somatic mutations adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene 63 colorectal tumors (16 adenomas 47 carcinomas) developed familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) non-FAP patients. In addition loss heterozygosity (LOH) APC locus 30 tumors, 43 somatic mutations detected. Twenty-one point mutations; 16 nonsense two missense mutations, three occurred introns splicing site. Twenty-two tumors frameshift mutations due deletion insertion; nineteen deletions one 31 bp three 1-bp insertion. One tumor 1-bp deletion intron near splicing site. Hence, 41 (95%) 43 mutations resulted truncation APC protein. Over 60% somatic mutations APC gene clustered within small region exon 15, designated MCR (mutation cluster region), accounted less 10% coding region. Combining data results LOH, 80% tumors (14 adenomas 39 carcinomas) least one mutation APC gene, 60% (9 adenomas 23 carcinomas) two mutations. These results strongly suggest somatic mutations APC gene associated development great majority colorectal tumors.. Identification altered splice site Ashkenazi Tay-Sachs disease. Tay-Sachs disease autosomal recessive genetic disorder resulting mutation HEXA gene encoding alpha-subunit lysosomal enzyme, beta-N-acetylhexosaminidase A (ref. 1). A relatively high frequency carriers (1/27) lethal, infantile form disease found Ashkenazi Jewish population, yet evident whether resulted founder effect random genetic drift selective advantage heterozygotes. We identified single-base mutation cloned fragment HEXA gene Ashkenazi Jewish patient. This change, substitution C G first nucleotide intron 12 expected result defective splicing messenger RNA. A test mutant allele based amplification DNA polymerase chain rection cleavage DdeI restriction site generated mutation revealed case two cases Ashkenazi, infantile form Tay-Sachs disease heterozygous two different mutations. The occurrence multiple mutant alleles warrants examination selective advantage hypothesis.. Coats' disease retina (unilateral retinal telangiectasis) caused somatic mutation NDP gene: role norrin retinal angiogenesis. Coats disease characterized abnormal retinal vascular development (so-called retinal telangiectasis) results massive intraretinal subretinal lipid accumulation (exudative retinal detachment). The classical form Coats disease almost invariably isolated, unilateral seen males. A female unilateral variant Coats disease gave birth son affected Norrie disease. Both carried missense mutation within NDP gene chromosome Xp11. 2 2. Subsequently analysis retinas nine enucleated eyes males Coats disease demonstrated one somatic mutation NDP gene present within non-retinal tissue. We suggest Coats telangiectasis secondary somatic mutation NDP gene results deficiency norrin (the protein product NDP gene) within developing retina. This supports recent observations protein critical normal retinal vasculogenesis. Trisomy 15 loss paternal 15 cause Prader-Willi syndrome due maternal disomy. Uniparental disomy recently recognized cause human disorders, including Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We describe particularly instructive case raises important issues concerning mechanisms producing uniparental disomy whose evaluation provides evidence trisomy may precede uniparental disomy fetus. Chorionic villus sampling performed advanced maternal age revealed trisomy 15 direct cultured cells, though fetus appeared normal. Chromosome analysis amniocytes obtained 15 wk normal 100 cells studied. The child hypotonic birth, high-resolution banding failed reveal deletion 15q11-13, deletion found 50% -70% patients PWS. Over time, typical features PWS developed. Molecular genetic analysis using probes chromosome 15 revealed maternal disomy. Maternal nondisjunction fertilization disomic egg normal sperm, followed loss paternal 15, likely cause confined placental mosaicism uniparental disomy case PWS, advanced maternal age may predisposing factor.. Genetic defect secretion complement C5 mice. A genetic deficiency fifth (C5) component complement1-3, serum glycoprotein molecular weight (MW) 220, 000 (ref. 4), found 39% inbred strains mice3. Sera deficient mice lack detectable C5 activity protein2, 3. In addition deficient mice produce antibody mouse C5 injected sera C5 sufficient (normal) strains. Levy et al. 5 showed somatic cell hybrids C5 deficient (B10. D2/old line) macrophages either C5 sufficient (B10. D2/new line) mouse kidney chicken erythroblasts secreted haemolytically active mouse C5 vitro. Several possible molecular mechanisms account findings considered, insufficient direct data available choose among them. We recently reported mouse (CD. 1 strain) peritoneal cells culture synthesise secrete single chain precursor, pro-C5 (MW approximately 210, 000), two-chain (alpha chain, 125, 000 beta chain 83, 000 MW) C5 protein6. Radiolabelled precursor C5 contained within cells secreted tissue culture media. Using similar methods, find C5 deficiency five different mouse strains (AKR, SWR, DBA/2J8 A/HeJ B10. D2/old line) due failure secretion C5 protein failure biosynthesis pro-C5 WASP gene mutations Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome X-linked thrombocytopenia. The WASP gene recently cloned Xp11. 23 shown mutated three patients Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS). We developed screening protocol identifying WASP gene alterations genomic DNA identified spectrum novel mutations 12 additional unrelated families. These missense, nonsense frameshift mutations involve eight 12 exons gene. Two mutations creating premature termination codons associated lack detectable mRNA Northern blots. Four amino acid substitutions, Leu27Phe, Thr48Ile, Val75Met Arg477Lys, found patients congenital thrombocytopenia clinically evident immune defect indicating WASP gene site mutations X-linked thrombocytopenia well WAS. A T-cell line WAS patient contained two independent DNA alterations, constitutional frameshift mutation, also present peripheral blood leukocytes patient, compensatory splice site mutation unique cell line. The distribution eight missense mutations provides valuable information amino acids essential normal protein function, suggests sites first two exons hot-spots mutation. Detection nonsense mutation dystrophin gene multiple SSCP. A combination multiplex PCR single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) technique employed screen point mutations human dystrophin gene. Co-amplification 11 exons genomic DNA Duchenne Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD/BMD) patients deletion duplication performed samples subjected multiple SSCP analysis.

Considered together, members family present almost complete clinical, genetic, behavioral picture disease.. Two new arylsulfatase A (ARSA) mutations juvenile metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) patient. Fragments arylsulfatase A (ARSA) gene patient juvenile-onset metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) amplified PCR ligated MP13 cloning vectors. Clones hybridizing cDNA human ARSA selected, examined appropriate size inserts, used prepare single-stranded phage DNA. Examination entire coding intronic sequence revealed two putative disease-related mutations. One, point mutation exon 3, resulted substitution isoleucine serine. Introduction alteration normal ARSA cDNA sequence resulted substantial decrease ARSA activity transient expression cultured baby hamster kidney cells. About 5% control expression observed, suggesting small residual activity mutated ARSA. The second mutation, G-to-A transition, occurred allele resulted altered splice-recognition sequence exon 7 following intron. The mutation also resulted loss restriction site. Apparently normal levels mRNA generated allele, ARSA activity immuno-cross-reactive material could detected. A collection DNA samples known suspected MLD patients, members families, normal controls screened mutations. Four additional individuals carrying mutations found among nearly 100 MLD patients sample. Gene segregation original patients family consistent available clinical biochemical data. No individuals homozygous either two mutations identified. However, combinations MLD mutations suggest point mutation exon 3 result residual enzyme activity associated late-onset forms disease. The splice-site mutation following exon 7 produces late-infantile MLD combined enzyme-null mutations, implying completely silent enzymatically.. Null mutation murine ATP7B (Wilson disease) gene results intracellular copper accumulation late-onset hepatic nodular transformation. The Atp7b protein copper-transporting ATPase expressed predominantly liver lesser extent tissues. Mutations ATP7B gene lead Wilson disease, copper toxicity disorder characterized dramatic build-up intracellular hepatic copper subsequent hepatic neuro-logical abnormalities. Using homologous recombination disrupt normal translation ATP7B, generated strain mice homozygous mutants (null) Wilson disease gene. The ATP7B null mice display gradual accumulation hepatic copper increases level 60-fold greater normal 5 months age. An increase copper concentration also observed kidney, brain, placenta lactating mammary glands homo-zygous mutants, although milk mutant glands copper deficient. Morphological abnormalities resembling cirrhosis developed majority livers homozygous mutants older 7 months age. Progeny homozygous mutant females demonstrated neurological abnormalities growth retardation characteristic copper deficiency. Copper concentration livers newborn homozygous null mutants decreased dramatically. In summary, inactivation murine ATP7B gene produces form cirrhotic liver disease resembles Wilson disease humans toxic milk phenotype mouse.. Adrenoleukodystrophy adrenomyeloneuropathy associated partial adrenal insufficiency three generations kindred. Four cases adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) one case adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) developed kindred three generations demonstrating AMN clinical variant ALD. Pituitary-adrenal function studies performed 10 family members, including two affected males four females identified carriers ALD/AMN. No pituitary-adrenal abnormality found carriers. However, basal morning plasma adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) levels markedly elevated two males ALD AMN, despite fact clinical signs adrenal insufficiency morning plasma cortisol levels response maximal exogenous ACTH stimulation appeared normal. In addition, integrated 24-hour response administration also subnormal two cases. Thus, people ALD AMN may subclinical partial adrenocrotical insufficiency. No endocrinologic dysfunction identified.. Identification mutations ALD-gene 20 families adrenoleukodystrophy/adrenomyeloneuropathy. Adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), X-linked inherited metabolic disorder, frequent inborn peroxisomal disease. It leads demyelination central peripheral nervous system.

All mutations could confirmed carriers sequencing genomic DNA. No correlation type mutation severity phenotype could observed. The mutations detected ALD gene 30 healthy persons.. Gonosomal mosaicism myotonic dystrophy patients: involvement mitotic events (CTG)n repeat variation selection extreme expansion sperm. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) caused abnormal expansion polymorphic (CTG) n repeat, located DM protein kinase gene. We determined (CTG) n repeat lengths broad range tissue DNAs patients mild, classical, congenital manifestation DM. Differences repeat length seen somatic tissues single DM individuals twins. Repeats appeared expand similar extent tissues originating embryonal origin. In male patients carrying intermediate- small-sized expansions blood, repeat lengths covered markedly wider range sperm. In contrast, male patients large allele expansions blood (> 700 CTGs) similar smaller repeats sperm, detectable. Sperm alleles > 1, 000 CTGs seen. We conclude DM patients considered gonosomal mosaics, i. e e., combined somatic germ-line tissue mosaics. Most remarkably, observed multiple cases length distributions intermediate- small-sized alleles fathers sperm significantly different offsprings blood. Our combined findings indicate intergenerational length changes unstable CTG repeat likely occur early embryonic mitotic divisions somatic germ-line tissue formation. Both initial CTG length, overall number cell divisions involved tissue formation, perhaps specific selection process spermatogenesis may influence dynamics process. A model explaining mitotic instability sex-dependent segregation phenomena DM manifestation discussed Combined analysis hereditary prostate cancer linkage 1q24-25: results 772 hereditary prostate cancer families International Consortium Prostate Cancer Genetics. A previous linkage study provided evidence prostate cancer-susceptibility locus 1q24-25. Subsequent reports additional collections families yielded conflicting results. In addition, evidence locus heterogeneity provided identification putative hereditary prostate cancer loci Xq27-28, 1q42-43, 1p36. The present study describes combined analysis six markers 1q24-25 region 772 families affected hereditary prostate cancer ascertained members International Consortium Prostate Cancer Genetics (ICPCG) North America, Australia, Finland, Norway, Sweden, United Kingdom. Overall, evidence linkage, peak parametric multipoint LOD score assuming heterogeneity (HLOD) 1. 40 (P =. 01) D1S212. The estimated proportion families (alpha) linked locus was. 06 (1-LOD support interval. 01-. 12). This evidence observed nonparametric approach, presumably extensive heterogeneity. Further parametric analysis revealed significant effect presence male-to-male disease transmission within families. In subset 491 families, peak HLOD 2. In subset 491 families, peak HLOD 2. 56 (P =. 0006) alpha =. 11 (1-LOD support interval. 04-. 19), compared HLODs 0 remaining 281 families. Within families male-to-male disease transmission, alpha increased early mean age diagnosis (< 65 years, alpha =. 19, 1-LOD support interval. 06-. 34) number affected family members (five family members, alpha =. 15, 1-LOD support interval. 04-. 28). The highest value alpha observed 48 families met three criteria (peak HLOD = 2. 25, P =. 001, alpha =. 29, 1-LOD support interval. 08-. 53). These results support finding prostate cancer-susceptibility gene linked 1q24-25, albeit defined subset prostate cancer families. Although HPC1 accounts small proportion families affected hereditary prostate cancer, appears play prominent role subset families several members affected early age male-to-male disease transmission. A novel disease deficiency mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. Palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity skin fibroblasts seven patients unidentified defects fatty acid oxidation measured presence absence antibodies medium-chain, long-chain, very-long-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenases (VLCAD). Two patients, 4-5 month old boys, found novel disease, VLCAD deficiency, judged results low palmitoyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity lack immunoreactivity toward antibody raised purified VLCAD.. Inherited WT1 mutation Denys-Drash syndrome. Patients Denys-Drash syndrome (Wilms tumor, genital anomalies, nephropathy) demonstrated carry de novo constitutional mutations WT1, Wilms tumor gene chromosome 11p13. We report three new cases, two carrying previously described WT1 exon 9 mutation one novel WT1 exon 8 mutation. However, unlike patients previous reports, one three patients inherited affected allele phenotypically unaffected father. This observation indicates WT1 exon 9 mutation affecting 394Arg demonstrated one-half patients Denys-Drash syndrome may exhibit incomplete penetrance. Consequently, familial studies patients affected syndrome recommended.. Glucose/galactose malabsorption caused defect Na+/glucose cotransporter. Glucose/galactose malabsorption (GGM) autosomal recessive disease manifesting within first weeks life characterized selective failure absorb dietary glucose galactose intestine. The consequent severe diarrhoea dehydration usually fatal unless sugars eliminated diet. Intestinal biopsies GGM patients revealed specific defect Na (+) -dependent absorption glucose brush border. Normal glucose absorption mediated Na +/glucose cotransporter brush border membrane intestinal epithelium. Cellular influx driven transmembrane Na + electrochemical potential gradient; thereafter sugar moves blood across basolateral membrane via facilitated glucose carrier. We previously cloned sequenced Na +/glucose cotransporter normal human ileum shown gene, SGLT1, resides distal q arm chromosome 22. We amplified SGLT1 complementary DNA genomic DNA members family affected GGM polymerase chain reaction. Sequence analysis amplified products revealed single missense mutation SGLT1 cosegregates GGM phenotype results complete loss Na (+) -dependent glucose transport Xenopus oocytes injected complementary RNA.. Atm Bax cooperate ionizing radiation-induced apoptosis central nervous system. Ataxia-telangiectasia hereditary multisystemic disease resulting mutations ataxia telangiectasia, mutated (ATM) characterized neurodegeneration, cancer, immune defects, hypersensitivity ionizing radiation. The molecular details ATM function nervous system unclear, although neurological lesion ataxia-telangiectasia becomes apparent early life, suggesting developmental origin. The central nervous system (CNS) Atm-null mice shows pronounced defect apoptosis induced genotoxic stress, suggesting ATM functions eliminate neurons excessive genomic damage. Here, report death effector Bax required large proportion Atm-dependent apoptosis developing CNS ionizing radiation (IR). Although many regions CNS Bax-/- Atm-/- mice radioresistant, mice nullizygous Bax Atm showed additional reduction IR-induced apoptosis CNS. Therefore, although major IR-induced apoptotic pathway CNS requires Atm Bax, p53-dependent collateral pathway exists Atm- Bax-independent branches. Further, Atm- Bax-dependent apoptosis CNS also required caspase-3 activation. These data implicate Bax caspase-3 death effectors neurodegenerative pathways.. Novel Tay-Sachs disease mutations China. We describe three HEXA mutations associated infantile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) three unrelated nonconsanguineous Chinese families. Novel mutations found two families. The third previously reported mutation (G-- > A transition nt 1444) (Nakano et al., 1988). Direct sequencing PCR products identified novel insertion A nt 547 family 1. This change generates early termination codon 6 bp downstream insertion site. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization confirmed homozygosity proband. Single strand conformational polymorphism analysis direct sequencing amplified exon 13 revealed T-- > C transition nt 1453 corresponding amino acid substitution W485R second family. This mutation creates Fnu4HI restriction site. The proband homozygous allele. When site-specific mutagenized alpha cDNA carrying T-- > C transition nt 1453 expressed COS 1 cells hexosaminidase S activity detectable background. A G-- > A transition nt 1444 (exon 13) corresponding E482K substitution found third family. This mutation occurs CpG dinucleotide. It reported Italian TSD proband causes defective intracellular transport alpha-subunit rough endoplasmic reticulum Golgi apparatus. Glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency incidence hematologic malignancy.

The map comprises contig 137 overlapping yeast artificial chromosomes P1 clones, onto placed 112 PCR markers. We localized 20 genes map, ten mapped region previously, isolated 30 cDNA clones representing partial sequences yet unidentified genes. Two genes lie within narrow region defined meiotic breakpoints BRCA1 patients sequenced breast cancer patients without revealing deleterious mutations. These new reagents facilitate identification BRCA1.. Sulfate transport impaired pendred syndrome thyrocytes. Pendred syndrome common form syndromic deafness, characterized dyshormonogenic goiter associated sensory-neural deafness. The gene responsible disease (PDS) cloned, function yet unknown connection thyroid goiter sensory-neural deafness remains enigma. PDS codes novel protein, pendrin, closely related number sufate transporters. Mechanisms abnormal sulfate transport could deleteriously affect iodide organification proposed. We tested sulfate transport thyrocytes obtained Pendred syndrome patients found defective. This suggests pendrin fact may sulfate transporter, emphasizes importance functional studies novel protein.. Spinal xanthomatosis: variant cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis. We describe seven Dutch patients six families slowly progressive, mainly spinal cord syndrome remained many years sole expression cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX). MRI demonstrated white matter abnormalities lateral dorsal columns spinal cord. Post-mortem examination one patients showed extensive myelin loss columns. An array genotypes found patients. We conclude spinal xanthomatosis clinical radiological separate entity CTX included differential diagnosis chronic myelopathy.. The exon 13 duplication BRCA1 gene founder mutation present geographically diverse populations. The BRCA1 Exon 13 Duplication Screening Group. Recently, 6-kb duplication exon 13, creates frameshift coding sequence BRCA1 gene, described three unrelated U. S S. families European ancestry one Portuguese family. Here, goal estimate frequency geographic diversity carriers duplication. To this, collaborative screening study set involved 39 institutions 19 countries included 3, 580 unrelated individuals family history disease 934 early-onset breast and/or ovarian cancer cases. A total 11 additional families carrying mutation identified Australia (1), Belgium (1), Canada (1), Great Britain (6), United States (2). Haplotyping showed likely derive common ancestor, possibly northern British origin. Our results demonstrate strongly advisable, laboratories carrying screening either English-speaking countries countries historical links Britain, include within BRCA1 screening protocols polymerase chain reaction-based assay described report. Germline mutations BRCA1 gene breast ovarian cancer families provide evidence genotype-phenotype correlation. Mutations BRCA1 gene, discovered 1994, associated 80-90% lifetime risk breast cancer. We analysed 60 families history breast and/or ovarian cancer germline mutations BRCA1. Twenty-two different mutations detected 32 families (53%), 14 previously unreported. We observed significant correlation location mutation gene ratio breast ovarian cancer incidence within family. Our data suggest transition risk mutations 3 third gene associated lower proportion ovarian cancer. Haplotype analysis supports previous data suggest BRCA1 mutation carriers common ancestors; however, found least two examples recurrent mutations appear arisen independently.. Inactivation Friedreich ataxia mouse gene leads early embryonic lethality without iron accumulation. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), common autosomal recessive ataxia, caused almost cases homozygous intronic expansions resulting loss frataxin, mitochondrial protein conserved evolution, involved mitochondrial iron homeostasis. Yeast knockout models, histological biochemical data patient heart biopsies autopsies indicate frataxin defect causes specific iron-sulfur protein deficiency mitochondrial iron accumulation leading pathological changes. Affected human tissues rarely available examine hypothesis. To study mechanism disease, generated mouse model deletion exon 4 leading inactivation Frda gene product. We show homozygous deletions cause embryonic lethality days implantation, demonstrating important role frataxin early development. These results suggest milder phenotype humans due residual frataxin expression associated expansion mutations. Surprisingly, frataxin knockout mouse, iron accumulation observed embryonic resorption, suggesting cell death could due mechanism independent iron accumulation.. A glycine250--> aspartate substitution alpha-subunit hexosaminidase A causes juvenile-onset Tay-Sachs disease Lebanese-Canadian family. The mutation causing juvenile Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) two sibs Lebanese-Maronite origin described. An mRNA-containing extract cultured fibroblasts obtained one probands used template amplify coding sequence hexosaminidase A (Hex A) alpha-subunit. Sequencing amplified cDNA fragments revealed single alteration, guanine adenine nt 749 creating G250D mutation. The mutation introduces new recognition site restriction enzyme Eco RV, permitting identification heterozygotes allele following PCR amplification Eco RV digestion exon 7 sequences genomic DNA templates. In order test effect substitution, vitro mutagenized cDNA construct introduced mammalian expression vector transfected monkey Cos-1 cells separately along beta-cDNA expression vector. When mutant alpha-cDNA gene introduced COS cells enzymatic activity endogenous COS cell activity detected. Cotransfection normal alpha-cDNA beta-cDNA followed immunoprecipitation human Hex A resulted 20-fold increase ratio positive negative (mock transfection) control values. This allowed detection residual activity (12% positive control) mutant alpha-cDNA replaced wild-type counterpart. The predicted protein environment mutation occurs compared adult-onset Tay-Sachs disease mutation caused Gly269-- > Ser substitution exon 7. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS). Restriction ocular fundus lesions specific subgroup APC mutations adenomatous polyposis coli patients. In humans, alteration tumor suppressor gene, APC, causes adenomatous polyposis coli, condition causing predisposition colorectal cancer. The syndrome inconsistently associates characteristic patches congenital hypertrophy retinal pigment epithelium (CHRPE). Ocular examination revealed patients expressing CHRPE tend cluster within specific families. The exact APC mutation identified 42 unrelated patients. In cases mutations predicted lead synthesis truncated protein. The extent CHRPE found dependent position mutation along coding sequence. CHRPE lesions almost always absent mutation occurs exon 9, systematically present occurs exon. Thus, range phenotypic expression observed among affected patients may result part different allelic manifestations APC mutations.. Linkage analysis 26 Canadian breast breast-ovarian cancer families. We examined 26 Canadian families hereditary breast ovarian cancer linkage markers flanking BRCA1 gene chromosome 17q12-q21. Of 15 families contain cases ovarian cancer, 94% estimated linked BRCA1. In contrast, overall evidence linkage group 10 families breast cancer without ovarian cancer. A genetic recombinant breast-ovarian cancer family indicates placement BRCA1 telomeric D17S776, helps define region assignment cancer susceptibility gene. Other cancers interest appeared BRCA1-linked families included primary peritoneal cancer, cancer fallopian tube, malignant melanoma.. Malignant neoplasms families patients ataxia-telangiectasia. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) autosomal recessive syndrome associated greatly increased incidence malignant neoplasms homozygous affected individuals. Heterozygotes gene A-T thought comprise 1% general population and, therefore, important know whether gene also predisposes heterozygous carrier cancers. Heterozygous carriers gene common among close relatives patients A-T, although individual carriers cannot identified clinical criterion laboratory test. For reason, compared incidence death malignant neoplasms 2 families patients A-T expected random sample general population. There 59 deaths malignant neoplasms relatives dying age 75, compared 42. 6 expected (p less 0. 02). For A-T heterozygotes younger age 45, risk dying malignant neoplasm estimated greater 5 times risk general population. A-T heterozygotes may comprise 5% persons dying cancer age 45. The incidence ovarian, gastric, biliary system carcinomas leukemia lymphoma increased A-T families. Other neoplasms may associated gene heterozygotes include pancreatic, basal cell, colonic, breast, cervical carcinomas. Molecular genetics PKU eastern Europe: nonsense mutation associated haplotype 4 phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. Phenylketonuria (PKU) genetic disorder secondary deficiency hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). Several mutations PAH gene recently reported, linkage disequilibrium observed RFLP haplotypes specific mutations.

The C-to-T transition causes substitution Arg243 termination codon, mutant allele associated haplotype 4 PAH gene. The mutation present two nine mutant haplotype 4 alleles among Eastern Europeans present among Western Europeans Asians. The rarity mutant allele restricted geographic distribution suggest mutational event occurred recently normal haplotype 4 background Eastern Europe.. Isolation mouse homologue BRCA1 genetic mapping mouse chromosome 11. The BRCA1 gene large part responsible hereditary human breast ovarian cancer. Here report isolation murine Brca1 homologue cDNA clones. In addition, identified genomic P1 clones contain most, all, mouse Brca1 locus. DNA sequence analysis revealed mouse human coding regions 75% identical nucleotide level predicted amino acid identity 58%. A DNA sequence variant Brca1 locus identified used map gene (Mus m. musculus Czech II x C57BL/KsJ) F1 x C57BL/KsJ intersubspecific backcross distal mouse chromosome 11. The mapping gene region highly syntenic human chromosome 17, coupled Southern Northern analyses, confirms isolated murine Brca1 homologue rather related RING finger gene. The isolation mouse Brca1 homologue facilitate creation mouse models germline BRCA1 defects.. Human deficiency sixth component complement patient meningococcal meningitis haemostasis abnormality. A case human complete C6 deficiency reported. The patient, 31 year old white male, seen occasion isolated episode meningococcal meningitis. Serum complement hemolytic bactericidal activities lacking could restored normal addition appropriate amounts purified C6. No hemostatic abnormalities observed.. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: refinement localization Xp identification another closely linked marker locus, OATL1. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) previously mapped proximal short arm X chromosome DXS14 DXS7 loci. In study, segregation analysis performed using newly identified WAS family well additional marker probe, HOATL1. The results indicate close linkage WAS OATL1 loci (Z = 6. 08 theta = 0. 00) localize TIMP, OATL1, DXS255, WAS loci distal DXS146 OATL1 WAS loci proximal TIMP. These linkage data narrow boundaries within WAS locus maps chromosomal region bracketed TIMP DXS146 support loci order Xpter-DXS7-TIMP- (OATL1, WAS, DXS255) -DXS146. Hereditary deficiency third component complement child fever, skin rash, arthralgias: response transfusion whole blood. A previously well 34-month-old male presenting fever, skin rash, arthralgias found lack C3 immunochemical (undetectable) hemolytic (1% normal) assays. No infectious agent could demonstrated. Protein levels Clq. C4, C5, properdin, C3b-INA hemolytic activities complement components C1 C9 except C3 normal elevated; total hemolytic complement activity 13% normal reconstituted purified C3. Properdin factor B 702 (normal 175 275) mug/ml, cleaver upon addition zymosan cobra venom factor. The serum normal immune adherence activity, deficient ability opsonize Candida albicans uptake Escherichia coli killing neurophils, generate neutrophil chemotactic factors inhibit growth E. coli; activities restored purified C3. A transfusion 320 ml 1-hour-old normal whole blood fifty-second day resulted transitory elevation C3 level 25 mg/dl fall-off (approximately 2 1/2% per hour) undetectable levels 69 hours; followed disappearance skin rash arthralgias return normal previously elevated temperature CRP levels. C3 levels family members (seven 24 half-normal), lack anti-C3 activity, normal C3b-INA levels normal rate catabolism transfused C3 indicated deficiency inherited autosomal codominance involved decreased synthesis C3. Thus, child unique individual inherited C3 deficiency presenting absence repeated infections, whose symptoms fever, skin rash, arthralgia abated whole blood transfusion.. Cloning breakpoints chromosome translocation identifies AN2 locus. Chromosome translocations involving 11p13 associated familial aniridia two kindreds highlighting chromosomal localization AN2 locus. This locus also part WAGR complex (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, mental retardation). In one kindred, translocation associated deletion, probes region used identify clone breakpoints translocation second kindred. Comparison phage restriction maps exclude presence sizable deletion case. Sequences chromosome 11 breakpoint conserved multiple species, suggesting translocation falls within AN2 gene.. Study voltage-gated sodium channel beta 1 subunit gene (SCN1B) benign familial infantile convulsions syndrome (BFIC). Benign familial infantile convulsions (BFIC) rare autosomal dominant epilepsy syndrome. This syndrome recently described Italian French pedigrees. Patients present partial, generalized seizures, onset age three months. The seizures usually spontaneously cease one year without treatment, leaving neurological abnormalities. We mapped BFIC chromosome 19q five Italian pedigrees. The sodium channel beta1 subunit gene (SCN1B) maps candidate region shown involved one Australian pedigree generalized epilepsy febrile seizures " plus " (GEFS +). In family, missense mutation SCN1B cosegregates GEFS + phenotype. BFIC GEFS + clinical features common, therefore SCN1B candidate gene BFIC. We studied SCN1B exons 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, using four SSCP methods 10 Caucasian BFIC probands Western Europe. We found exon variants. One variant identified intron 5 (IVS5-10C > G), segregate BFIC observed 9. 2% controls. A second variant intron 5 identified (IVS5 + 30G > A). It rare, observed controls, segregating BFIC phenotype. Brain disease molecular analysis myotonic dystrophy. Abnormal amplification CTG repeat chromosome 19 molecular basis myotonic dystrophy (DM). Expansion repeat correlated severity several clinical features disease. We performed extensive cognitive testing, cerebral magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) molecular analysis 28 cases DM determine relationship molecular defect brain disease. Performance two cognitive tests pathological 10 cases. Fourteen patients subcortical white matter lesions MRI, 14 cerebral atrophy. Amplification CTG repeat showed strong correlation cognitive test deficits exceeding length 1000 trinucleotides. MRI lesions associated impaired psychometric performance, MRI molecular findings weakly related. Disease duration influenced appearance amount white matter lesions MRI. Quantification CTG repeat size may allow early estimate probability brain involvement DM; cognitive dysfunction associated white matter lesions cerebral atrophy later course.. A highly accurate, low cost test BRCA1 mutations. The hereditary breast ovarian cancer syndrome associated high frequency BRCA1 mutations. However, widespread use BRCA1 testing limited date three principal concerns fear loss health life insurance, uncertain clinical value positive test result, current lack inexpensive sensitive screening test BRCA1 mutations. We developed inexpensive system gene mutational scanning, based combination extensive multiplex PCR amplification two dimensional electrophoresis. The efficiency system, screening test BRCA1 mutations, evaluated panel 60 samples high risk women, 14 contained previously identified mutation BRCA1. All 14 mutations identified, well additional five previously escaped detection. In addition 19 mutations, total 15 different polymorphic variants scored, recurring. All confirmed nucleotide sequencing. The cost screening per sample calculated approximately US $ 70 manual technique used study, may reduced approximately US $ 10 introduction commercially available PCR robotics fluorescent imaging. Implementation method mutation screening research clinical setting permit rapid accrual quantitative data genotype-phenotype associations evaluation diagnostic testing.. Germline mutations APC gene Korean familial adenomatous polyposis patients. We extensively analyzed genomic DNA messenger RNA (mRNA) 62 unrelated Korean patients familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) identification germline adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene mutations. We adopted single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis method analysis involving reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) followed protein truncation test (PTT). DNA sequencing confirmed alterations represented aberrant bands. Germline mutations identified 38 patients (61%). Nineteen detected mutations presumed novel, thus emphasizing heterogeneity mutational spectrum Korean FAP patients. In initial 48 patients, SSCP analysis followed PTT patients detectable mutations found SSCP. Using combined approach, identified germline APC gene mutations 29 48 FAP patients (60%), including 6 patients SSCP analysis failed distinguish mutant allele. In 14 later patients, identified truncating mutations 9 patients (64%) using PTT only. Our results confirm mutation detection rate PTT superior SSCP, suggest PTT would practical screening method detect germline mutations APC gene FAP patients. Homozygosity mapping family microcephaly, mental retardation, short stature Cohen syndrome region 8q21.3-8q22.1: redefining clinical entity. A syndrome microcephaly, progressive postnatal growth deficiency, mental retardation observed two brothers cousin multiply consanguineous kindred Lebanese descent. Hypotonia, chorioretinal dystrophy, myopia also identified. The severity condition varied among closely related patients. Because absence distinctive facial appearance, degree mental retardation, short stature, initially considered clinical diagnosis Cohen syndrome withdrawn novel genetic entity assumed. Homozygosity mapping family assigned gene 26. 8-cM region chromosome band 8q21. 3 -22. 1, microsatellites D8S270 D8S514. The maximum two-point LOD score found marker D8S267 (Zmax = 3.. 237 Omax = 0. 00). Intriguingly enough, identified gene region overlaps refined gene region Cohen syndrome (COH1) [Kolehmainen et al., 1997 Euro J Hum Genet 5 206-213]. This fact encourages hypothesis described kindred segregates variant Cohen syndrome suggests redefinition phenotype Spontaneous reversion novel Lesch-Nyhan mutation HPRT gene rearrangement. Molecular analysis unusual patient Lesch-Nyhan syndrome suggested mutation due partial HPRT gene duplication. We report cloning sequencing mutant HPRT cDNA shows precise duplication exons 2 3. This mutation result internal duplication 16-20 kilobases gene. The structure mutant gene suggests duplication generated single unequal crossing-over event two normal HPRT alleles. Growth Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblasts patient selective medium permitted isolation spontaneous HPRT + revertants mutation. The reversion event involves second major HPRT gene rearrangement duplicated portion mutant gene deleted. The original mutation therefore potential spontaneous somatic reversion. This may explain relatively mild symptoms Lesch-Nyhan syndrome exhibited patient.. Nephropathy Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome. Nephropathy detected five 32 patients Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome participating study transfer factor (TF) therapy. In two patients, nephropathy present TF appear changed TF therapy. One patients subsequently developed progressive renal failure requiring dialysis beginning 5 1/2 years TF therapy. In two patients, decreased renal function appeared soon administration TF. One patient showed gradually decreasing renal function beginning two years TF therapy. An additional patient identified died renal failure without received TF. The results suggest renal failure occurs Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome frequently generally recognized administration TF may precipitate accelerate renal disease patients syndrome.. Aniridia-associated cytogenetic rearrangements suggest position effect may cause mutant phenotype. Current evidence suggests aniridia (absence iris) caused loss function one copy PAX6 gene, maps 11p13. We present characterisation two aniridia pedigrees disease segregates chromosomal rearrangements involve 11p13 disrupt PAX6 gene. We isolated three human YAC clones encompass PAX6 locus used show cases chromosomal breakpoint least 85 kb distal 3 end PAX6. In addition, open reading frame PAX6 apparently free mutations. We propose PAX6 gene rearranged chromosome 11 inappropriate chromatin environment normal expression therefore position effect underlying mechanism disease families.. Genetic cholesteryl ester transfer protein deficiency caused two prevalent mutations major determinant increased levels high density lipoprotein cholesterol. Genetic determinants HDL cholesterol (HDL-C) levels general population poorly understood. We previously described plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency due intron 14 G (+ 1) -to-A mutation (Int14 A) several families high HDL-C levels Japan. Subjects HDL-C > = 100 mg/dl (n = 130) screened PCR single strand conformational polymorphism analysis CETP gene. Two mutations identified DNA sequencing primer-mediated restriction map modification PCR products novel intron 14 splice donor site mutation caused T insertion position + 3 exon14/intron14 boundary (Int14 T) missense mutation (Asp442 Gly) within exon 15 (D442G). The Int14 T mutation found one family. However, D442G Int14 A mutations highly prevalent subjects HDL-C > = 60 mg/dl, combined allele frequencies 9%, 12%, 21% 43% HDL-C 60-79, 80-99, 100-119, > = 120 mg/dl, respectively. Furthermore, prevalences D442G Int14 A mutations extremely high general sample Japanese men (n = 236), heterozygote frequencies 7% 2%, respectively. These two mutations accounted 10% total variance HDL-C population. The phenotype genetic compound heterozygote (Int14 T Int14 A) similar Int14 A homozygotes (no detectable CETP markedly increased HDL-C), indicating Int14 T produces null allele. In four D442G homozygotes, mean HDL-C levels (86 +/- 26 mg/dl) lower Int14 A homozygotes (158 +/- 35 mg/dl), reflecting residual CETP activity plasma. In 47 D442G heterozygotes, mean HDL-C levels 91 +/- 23 mg/dl, similar level D442G homozygotes, significantly greater mean HDL-C levels Int14 A heterozygotes (69 +/- 15 mg/dl). Thus, D442G mutation acts differently null mutations weaker effects HDL homozygous state stronger effects heterozygotes, suggesting dominant expression partially defective allele. CETP deficiency, reflecting two prevalent mutations (D442G Int14 A), first example genetic deficiency state sufficiently common explain significant fraction variation HDL-C general population..

Confirmation linkage Van der Woude syndrome chromosome 1q32: evidence association STR alleles suggests possible unique origin disease mutation. Van der Woude syndrome (VWS) autosomal dominant craniofacial disorder high penetrance variable expression. Its clinical features variably expressed, include cleft lip and/or cleft palate, lip pits hypodontia. All VWS families studied date map disease gene < 2 cM region chromosome 1q32, evidence locus heterogeneity. The aim study refine localization VWS gene assess possible heterogeneity. We analyzed four multiplex VWS families. All available members clinically assessed genotyped 19 short tandem repeat markers chromosome 1 VWS candidate gene region. We performed two-point multipoint limit detection (LOD) score analyses using high penetrance autosomal dominant model. All families showed positive LOD scores without recombination candidate region. The largest two-point LOD score 5. 87 87. Our assay method short tandem repeat (STR) markers provided highly accurate size estimation marker allele fragment sizes, therefore enabled us determine specific alleles segregating VWS gene four families. We observed striking pattern STR allele sharing several closely linked loci among four Caucasian VWS families recruited three different locations US. These results suggest possibility unique origin mutation responsible many cases VWS. The carrier frequency BRCA1 185delAG mutation approximately 1 percent Ashkenazi Jewish individuals. Since BRCA1, first major gene responsible inherited breast cancer, cloned, 50 unique mutations detected germline individuals breast ovarian cancer. In high-risk pedigrees, female carriers BRCA1 mutations 80-90% lifetime risk breast cancer, 40-50% risk ovarian cancer. However, mutation stats individuals unselected breast ovarian cancer determined, known whether mutations individuals confer risk cancer individuals high-risk families studied far. Following finding 185delAG frameshift mutation several Ashkenazi Jewish breast/ovarian families, determined frequency mutation 858 Ashkenazim seeking genetic testing conditions unrelated cancer, 815 reference individuals selected ethnic origin. We observed 185delAG mutation 0. 9% Ashkenazim (95% confidence limit, 0. 4-1. 8%) none reference samples. Our results suggest one hundred women Ashkenazi descent may especially high risk developing breast and/or ovarian cancer.

In addition, mice manifest several characteristics occasionally observed human hypobetalipoproteinemia, including reduced plasma triglyceride concentrations, fasting chylomicronemia, reduced high density lipoprotein cholesterol. An unexpected finding modified Apob allele strongly associated exencephalus hydrocephalus. These mice help increase understanding hypobetalipoproteinemia, atherogenesis, etiology exencephalus hydrocephalus.. Common mutations BRCA1 BRCA2 contribute early prostate cancer Jewish men. BACKGROUND Families high incidence hereditary breast cancer, subsequently shown terminating mutations BRCA1 BRCA2, appear higher incidence prostate cancer among male relatives. We aimed determine whether common germline mutations BRCA1 BRCA2 Ashkenazi Jewish men predisposed prostate cancer. METHODS We examined genomic DNA 83 (for BRCA1 185delAG) 82 (for BRCA2 6174delT) Ashkenazi Jewish prostate cancer patients, treated relatively young age, common germline mutation gene seen Ashkenazi population. RESULTS Our study able detect 4-5-fold increase risk prostate cancer due mutation BRCA1 BRCA2. However, one (1. 15%; 95% confidence interval, 0-3. 6%) patients heterozygous BRCA1 mutant allele, two heterozygous BRCA2 mutation (2. 4%; 95% confidence interval, 0-6. 2%). CONCLUSIONS The incidence germline mutations prostate cancer patients closely matched incidence (about 1%) general Ashkenazi Jewish population. This suggests unlike cases breast ovarian cancers, mutations BRCA1 BRCA2 significantly predispose men prostate cancer Two new variants glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase associated hereditary non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia: G6PD Wayne G6PD Huron.

Patients G6PD Wayne underwent splenectomy objective improvement noted. The patients G6PD Huron medical observation considerable period time without diagnosis G6PD deficiency entertained family Northern European origin. Since sporadic variants G6PD causing HNSHA show special racial predilection, diagnosis G6PD deficiency always considered patients syndrome.. The Tay-Sachs disease gene North American Jewish populations: geographic variations origin. From data collected North American Tay-Sachs disease (TSD) heterozygote screening program, TSD carrier frequency among 46, 304 Jewish individuals found be. 0324 (1 31 individuals). This frequency consistent earlier estimates based TSD incidence data. TSD carrier frequencies examined single country single region origin 28, 029 Jews within sample data available analysis. Jews Polish and/or Russian ancestry constituted 88% sample TSD carrier frequency of. 0327. No TSD carriers observed among 166 Jews Near Eastern origins. Relative Jews Polish Russian origins, least twofold increase TSD carrier frequency Jews Austrian, Hungarian, Czechoslovakian origins (P less than. 005). These findings suggest TSD gene proliferated among antecedents modern Ashkenazi Jewry Second Diaspora (70 A. D.) major migrations regions Poland Russia (before 1100 A. D.). Novel inherited mutations variable expressivity BRCA1 alleles, including founder mutation 185delAG Ashkenazi Jewish families. Thirty-seven families four cases breast cancer breast ovarian cancer analyzed mutations BRCA1. Twelve different germ-line mutations, four novel eight previously observed, detected 16 families. Five families Ashkenazi Jewish descent carried 185delAG mutation shared haplotype eight polymorphic markers spanning approximately 850 kb BRCA1. Expressivity 185delAG families varied, early-onset breast cancer without ovarian cancer. Mutation 4184delTCAA occurred independently two families. In one family, penetrance complete, females developing early-onset breast cancer ovarian cancer male carrier developing prostatic cancer, whereas, family, penetrance incomplete breast cancer occurred, diagnosed ages 38-81 years.

Overall series, BRCA1 mutations detected 26 families 16 positive BRCA1 lod scores, 7 negative lod scores (reflecting multiple sporadic breast cancers), 3 tested linkage. Three families positive lod scores linkage BRCA2, 13 families without detected BRCA1 mutations negative lod scores BRCA1 BRCA2. Transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences expanded CTG repeat mimic closely DM CTG repeat intergenerational somatic instability. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) caused CTG repeat expansion 3UTR DM protein kinase (DMPK) gene. A high level instability observed successive generations size repeat generally correlated severity disease age onset. Furthermore, tissues DM patients exhibit somatic mosaicism increases age. We generated transgenic mice carrying large human genomic sequences 20, 55 > 300 CTG, cloned patients affected DM family. Using large human flanking sequences large amplification, demonstrate intergenerational CTG repeat instability reproduced mice, strong bias towards expansions sex- size-dependent characteristics humans. Moreover, high level instability, increasing age, observed tissues sperm. Although observe dramatic expansions (or big jumps several hundred CTG repeats) congenital forms DM, model carrying > 300 CTG first show instability close human DM situation. Our three models carrying different sizes CTG repeat provide insight different factors modulating CTG repeat instability.. Linkage gene C2 deficiency major histocompatibility complex MHC man.

Late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy Israel. Metachromatic Leukodystrophy (MLD) neurodegenerative disease lysosomal enzyme, Aryl sulfatase A (ARSA) deficient. The disease inherited autosomal recessive trait frequency estimated 1/40, 000 live births. The gene ARSA cloned eight mutations causing MLD reported. Another mutation, PD, leads deficiency enzyme vitro (pseudodeficiency) without known clinical effect. The PD mutation frequent populations. In Israel, late infantile MLD found frequent small Jewish isolate, Habbanite Jews (1/75 live births). The molecular analysis demonstrated Habbanite population, mutation occurred allele PD mutation. The loss ARSA activity due point mutation C > T leading change proline leucine. MLD also frequent among Moslem Arabs Jerusalem. The mutation transition G > A destroying splice donor site exon 2. This mutation reported patients late infantile MLD different ethnic groups. The Christian Arabs Israel also high incidence disease (1/10, 000 live births); mutation population still unknown. Knowledge different mutations causing MLD defined populations allow carrier screening program carried prevent birth additional affected children.. Genomic rearrangements APC tumor-suppressor gene familial adenomatous polyposis. Germline mutations adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene result hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Almost APC mutations identified single-nucleotide alterations, small insertions, small deletions would truncate protein product gene. No well-characterized intragenic rearrangement APC described, prevalence type mutation FAP patients clear. We screened 49 potential FAP families identified 26 different germline APC mutations 30 families. Four mutations genomic rearrangements resulting homologous nonhomologous recombinations mediated Alu elements. Two four rearrangements complex, involving deletion insertion nucleotides. Of four rearrangements, one resulted deletion exons 11 12 two others resulted either complete partial deletion exon 14. The fourth rearrangement grossly altered sequence within intron 14. Although rearrangement affect coding sequence APC genomic DNA level, caused inappropriate splicing exon 14. These rearrangements initially revealed analyzing cDNAs could identified using mutation detection methods screened exon individually. The identification rearrangement alter coding exons yet affected splicing underscores importance using cDNA mutation analysis. The identification four genomic rearrangements among 30 mutations suggests genomic rearrangements frequent germline APC mutations.. Familial male breast cancer linked BRCA1 locus chromosome 17q. Breast cancer men hundredfold less common women hindered research genetic basis. We examined 22 families least one case male breast cancer linkage hereditary breast ovarian cancer locus, BRCA1, chromosome 17q. We found strong evidence linkage BRCA1 (lod score-16. 63) best estimate proportion linked families 0% (95% CI 0-18%). Our results indicate gene (s) BRCA1 predisposes early-onset breast cancer women confers higher risk male breast cancer. Identification additional pedigrees include cases male breast cancer may therefore facilitate mapping isolation gene. Evidence inter-generational instability CAG repeat MJD1 gene conserved haplotypes flanking markers amongst Japanese Caucasian subjects Machado-Joseph disease. The size (CAG)n repeat array 3' end MJD1 gene haplotype series microsatellite markers surrounding MJD1 gene examined large cohort Japanese Caucasian subjects affected Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). Our data provide five novel observations. First, MJD associated expansion fo array normal range 14-37 repeats 68-84 repeats Japanese Caucasian subjects, subjects observed expansions intermediate size normal MJD affected groups. Second, expanded allele associated MJD displays inter-generational instability, particularly male meioses, instability associated clinical phenomenon anticipation. Third, size expanded allele inversely correlated age-of-onset MJD (r = -0.738, p < 0.001), also correlated frequency clinical features [e.g. pseudoexophthalmos pyramidal signs frequent subjects large repeats (p < 0.001 p < 0.05 respectively)]. Fourth, disease phenotype significantly severe early age onset (16 years) subject homozygous expanded allele, contrasts Huntington disease suggests expanded allele MJD1 gene could exert effect either dominant negative effect (putatively excluded HD) gain function effect proposed HD. Finally, Japanese Caucasian subjects affected MJD share haplotypes several markers surrounding MJD1 gene, uncommon normal Japanese Caucasian population, suggests existence either common founders populations chromosomes susceptible pathologic expansion CAG repeat MJD1 gene. Familial Prader-Willi syndrome apparently normal chromosomes. We report 4 sibs (2F, 2M) Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). Diagnosis made clinically basis history, behavior, physical findings 3 sibs. The child died age 10 months history clinical findings typical first phase PWS. Results chromosome studies parents surviving sibs normal. The implications unusual familial occurrence understanding PWS discussed.. Age diagnosis indicator eligibility BRCA1 DNA testing familial breast cancer. We searched criteria could indicate breast cancer families high prior probability caused breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility locus BRCA1 chromosome 17. To end, performed linkage study 59 consecutively collected Dutch breast cancer families, including 16 least one case ovarian cancer. We used intake cut-off least three first-degree relatives breast and/or ovarian cancer age. Significant evidence linkage found among 13 breast cancer families mean age diagnosis less 45 years. An unexpectedly low proportion breast-ovarian cancer families estimated linked BRCA1, could due founder effect Dutch population. Given expected logistical problems clinical management BRCA1 identified, propose interim period families strong positive family history early onset breast and/or ovarian cancer offered BRCA1 mutation testing.. Some Mexican glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variants revisited. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency appears fairly common Mexico. We examined DNA three previously reported electrophoretically fast Mexican G6PD variants, -G6PD Distrito Federal, G6PD Tepic, G6PD Castilla. All three variants, believed basis biochemical characterization population origin unique, G----A transition nucleotide 202 A----G transition nucleotide 376, mutations recognize characteristic G6PD A-. Two Mexican males G6PD deficiency found mutation. All five (NlaIII/FokI/PvuII/PstI) haplotype characteristic G6PD A -in Africa. Since PvuII + genotype seems rare Europe, conclude G6PD A - genes ancient origin Africa, although many Mexican patients G6PD A -202A/376G gene may imported recently Spain, variant, formerly known G6PD Betica, also prevalent.. Inactivation germline mutant APC alleles attenuated somatic mutations: molecular genetic mechanism attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis. Germline mutations adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) tumor-suppressor gene result familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). Patients FAP typically develop hundreds thousands benign colorectal tumors early-onset colorectal cancer. A subset germline APC mutations results attenuated FAP (AFAP) phenotype, patients develop fewer tumors develop older age. Although genotype-phenotype correlation locations APC germline mutations development AFAP well documented, mechanism AFAP well defined. We investigated mechanism AFAP patients carrying mutant APC allele (APC (AS9)) mutation alternatively spliced region exon 9. APC (AS9) found down-regulate beta-catenin-regulated transcription, major tumor-suppressor function APC, wild-type APC. Mutation analysis showed APC (AS9) wild-type APC alleles somatically mutated colorectal tumors patients. Functional analysis showed 4666insA, common somatic mutation APC (AS9) tumors, inactivate wild-type APC. Our results indicate carriers APC (AS9) develop fewer colorectal tumors typical patients FAP somatic inactivation APC alleles necessary colorectal tumorigenesis. However, patients develop colorectal tumors frequently general population APC (AS9) inactivated mutations inactivate wild-type APC.. Submicroscopic deletions WAGR locus, revealed nonradioactive situ hybridization. Fluorescence situ hybridization (FISH) biotin-labeled probes mapping 11p13 used molecular analysis deletions WAGR (Wilms tumor, aniridia, genitourinary abnormalities, mental retardation) locus. We detected submicroscopic 11p13 deletion child inherited aniridia subsequently presented Wilms tumor horseshoe kidney, revealed surgery. The mother, aniridia, also found carry deletion including aniridia candidate gene (AN2) Wilms tumor predisposition gene (WT1). This therefore rare case inherited WAGR deletion. Wilms tumor far associated sporadic de novo aniridia cases. We shown cosmid probe candidate aniridia gene, homologous mouse Pax-6 gene, deleted cell lines aniridia patients previously characterized deletions 11p13, another cosmid marker mapping two aniridia-associated translocation breakpoints (and hence second candidate marker) present chromosomes. These results support Pax-6 homologue strong candidate AN2 gene. FISH cosmid probes proved fast reliable technique molecular analysis deletions. It used limited amounts material strong potential clinical applications.. Haplotype studies Wilson disease. In 51 families Wilson disease, studied DNA haplotypes dinucleotide repeat polymorphisms (CA repeats) 13q14. 3 region, examine markers association Wilson disease gene (WND). In addition marker (D13S133) described elsewhere, developed three new highly polymorphic markers (D13S314, D13S315, D13S316) close WND locus. We examined distribution marker alleles loci studied found D13S314, D13S133, D13S316 show nonrandom distribution chromosomes carrying WND mutation. We studied haplotypes three markers found highly significant differences WND normal haplotypes northern European families. These findings important implications mutation detection molecular diagnosis families Wilson disease. Growth hormone treatment increases CO(2) response, ventilation central inspiratory drive children Prader-Willi syndrome. We studied whether beneficial effects growth hormone (GH) treatment growth body composition PWS accompanied improvement respiratory function. We measured resting ventilation, airway occlusion pressure (P (0. 1)) ventilatory response CO (2) nine children, aged 7-14 years, 6-9 months start GH treatment. During GH treatment, resting ventilation increased 26%, P (0. 1) 72% response CO (2) 65% (P < 0. 002, < 0. 04 < 0. 02, respectively). This observed increase ventilatory output correlated changes body mass index. CONCLUSION Treatment children Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) seems stimulatory effect central respiratory structures. The observed increase ventilation inspiratory drive may contribute improved activity level reported parents PWS children growth hormone therapy Somatic von Hippel-Lindau mutation clear cell papillary cystadenoma epididymis. Papillary cystadenoma epididymis uncommon benign lesion may occur sporadically manifestation von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Neither immunohistochemical studies molecular genetic analyses VHL gene reported previously lesion. The authors describe two cases clear cell papillary cystadenoma epididymis, initially confused metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Both lesions showed positive immunohistochemical staining low intermediate molecular weight keratins (Cam 5. 2 AE1/AE3), EMA, vimentin, alpha 1-antitrypsin, alpha 1-antichymotrypsin. Each negative CEA. Because clear cell papillary cystadenoma similar renal cell carcinoma histologically, occur components von Hippel-Lindau disease complex, authors analyzed cases presence mutations VHL gene. A somatic VHL gene mutation detected one two tumors polymerase chain reaction followed single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis. Direct sequencing revealed cytosine thymine transition nucleotide 694, resulting replacement arginine stop codon sixth amino acid exon 3. As VHL gene believed function tumor suppressor gene, VHL gene mutations may play role initiation tumorigenesis sporadic cystadenomas epididymis. An evaluation genetic heterogeneity 145 breast-ovarian cancer families. Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium. The breast-ovary cancer-family syndrome dominant predisposition cancer breast ovaries mapped chromosome region 17q12-q21. The majority, all, breast-ovary cancer families show linkage susceptibility locus, designated BRCA1. We report results linkage analysis 145 families breast ovarian cancer. These families contain either total three cases early-onset (before age 60 years) breast cancer ovarian cancer. All families contained least one case ovarian cancer. Overall, estimated 76% 145 families linked BRCA1 locus. None 13 families cases male breast cancer appear linked, estimated 92% (95% confidence interval 76% -100%) families male breast cancer two ovarian cancers linked BRCA1. These data suggest breast-ovarian cancer-family syndrome genetically heterogeneous. However, large majority families early-onset breast cancer two cases ovarian cancer likely due BRCA1 mutations.. Genetic analysis families van der Woude syndrome. We brought together information 864 affected individuals 164 families (including three new pedigrees) reported 137 year period since 1845 Demarquay first described family later called van der Woude syndrome (VWS). Both types oral cleft, cleft palate (CP) cleft lip without CP (CLP), segregate families together lower lip pits fistulae autosomal dominant mode high penetrance estimated K =. 89 and. 99 different methods. Cleft types (CLP CP) occur VWS proportions general non-VWS population, ie, twice many cleft-bearing individuals CLP CP. On hand, find usually observed excess females CP excess males CLP; VWS sex ratios nearly equal. Lip pits also equally distributed sexes. Affected males females equally likely transmit VWS. However, excess less severely affected individuals among transmitters deficiency severely affected, brought proband bias differential fecundity. The expression VWS significantly modified genetic background More extreme phenotypes parents tend produce extreme expression children. For VWS gene carrier relative risk transmitting cleft 26. 45%; transmitting lower lip pits 23. 55%. Three pedigrees lip pits literature show clefts among significant number affected individuals. Control gene expression VWS three target tissues appears independent separately designated. Mutation rate VWS gene calculated 1. 8 X 10 (-5) Molecular phenotypic analysis patients deletions within deletion-rich region Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene. Eighty unrelated individuals Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD)or Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD) found deletions major deletion-rich region DMD locus. This region includes last five exons detected cDNA5b-7, exons detected cDNA8, first two exons detected cDNA9. These 80 individuals account approximately 75% 109 deletions gene, detected among 181 patients analyzed entire dystrophin cDNA. Endpoints many deletions characterized using two genomic probes, p20 (DXS269; Wapenaar et al.) GMGX11 (DXS239; present paper). Clinical findings presented 80 patients allowing correlation phenotypic severity genotype. Thirty-eight independent patients old enough classified DMD, BMD, intermediate phenotype deletions exons sequenced intron/exon boundaries. Of these, eight BMD patients one intermediate patient gene deletions predicted leave reading frame intact, 21 DMD patients, 7 intermediate patients, 1 BMD patient gene deletions predicted disrupt reading frame. Thus, two exceptions, frameshift deletions gene resulted severe phenotype in-frame deletions. This agreement recent findings Baumbach et al. Koenig et al. contrast findings, Malhotra et al. 5 ' end gene. Proteolipoprotein gene analysis 82 patients sporadic Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease: duplications, major cause disease, originate frequently male germ cells, point mutations not. The Clinical European Network Brain Dysmyelinating Disease. Pelizaeus-Merzbacher Disease (PMD) X-linked developmental defect myelination affecting central nervous system segregating proteolipoprotein (PLP) locus. Investigating 82 strictly selected sporadic cases PMD, found PLP mutations 77%; complete PLP-gene duplications frequent abnormality (62%), whereas point mutations coding splice-site regions gene involved less frequently (38%). We analyzed maternal status 56 cases determine origin types PLP mutation, since relevant genetic counseling. In 22 point mutations, 68% mothers heterozygous mutation, value identical two-thirds carrier mothers would expected equal mutation rate male female germ cells. In sharp contrast, among 34 duplicated cases, 91% mothers carriers, value significantly (chi2 = 9. 20, P <. 01) favor male bias, estimation male/female mutation frequency (k) 9. 3 3. Moreover, observed occurrence de novo mutations parental grandparental generations 17 three-generation families, allowed direct estimation k value (k = 11). Again, significant male mutation imbalance observed duplications. Haplotype analysis phenylalanine hydroxylase gene Turkish phenylketonuria families. We estimated haplotype distribution mutant normal phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) alleles 17 Turkish phenylketonuria (PKU) families 20 normal 27 mutated PAH alleles could identified. Of latter, prevalent associated haplotype 6 (29. 6%), 1 (18. 5%) 36 (11. 1%), normal alleles preferentially associated haplotype 1 (20%). Of 19 different haplotypes observed, 5 described previously. The haplotype distribution differed significantly Northern European population. Two eight polymorphic sites association PKU. No deletions exon sequences found families analysed. Cloning human very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase molecular characterization deficiency two patients. Two overlapping cDNA clones (1, 991 bp 736 bp, respectively) encoding precursor human mitochondrial very-long-chain acyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase (VLCAD) cloned sequenced. The cDNA inserts clones together encompass region 2, 177 bases, encoding entire protein 655 amino acids, including 40-amino acid leader peptide 615-amino acid mature polypeptide. PCR-amplified VLCAD cDNAs sequenced cultured fibroblasts two VLCAD-deficient patients. In patients, 105-bp deletion encompassing bases 1078-1182 VLCAD cDNA identified. The deletion seems occur due exon skipping processing VLCAD pre-mRNA. This first demonstration mutation causing VLCAD deficiency. Quantitative cDNA expression normal human VLCAD performed patients fibroblasts, using vaccinia viral system, demonstrated deficiency normal VLCAD protein causes impaired long-chain fatty acid beta-oxidation activity patients fibroblasts. In patient fibroblasts, raising VLCAD activity approximately 20% normal control fibroblast activity raised palmitic acid beta-oxidation flux level found control fibroblasts, may offer important information rational design future somatic gene therapy VLCAD deficiency.. Mutations RB1 gene effects transcription. Inactivation alleles RB1 gene normal retinal development initiates formation retinoblastoma (RB) tumor. To identify mutations inactivate RB1, 21 RB tumors isolated 19 patients analyzed polymerase chain reaction RNase protection assay both. Mutations identified 13 21 RB tumors; 8 tumors, precise errors nucleotide sequence characterized. Each four germ line mutations involved small deletion duplication, three somatic mutations point mutations leading splice alterations loss exon mature RB1 mRNA. We unable detect expression mutant allele lymphoblasts three bilaterally affected patients, although mutation present genomic DNA transcripts containing mutations obvious RB tumors absence normal RB1 allele. The variations level expression mutant transcripts suggest deregulation RB1 transcription absence functional RB1 gene product.. Resolution two loci autosomal dominant aniridia, AN1 AN2, single locus chromosome 11p13. Two distinct loci proposed aniridia; AN1 autosomal dominant aniridia chromosome 2p AN2 aniridia WAGR contiguous gene syndrome chromosome 11p13. In report, kindred segregating autosomal dominant aniridia, suggested linkage acid phosphatase-1 (ACP1) led assignment AN1 locus chromosome 2p, updated expanded. Linkage analysis aniridia phenotype ACP1 support original linkage results, excluding linkage theta = 0. 17 Z = -2. Tests linkage chromosome 2p markers. APOB, D2S71, D2S5, D2S1, also excluded linkage aniridia. Markers isolated chromosome 11p13 region analyzed aniridia family. Two RFLPs D11S323 locus give significant evidence linkage. The PvuII polymorphism detected probe p5S1. 6 detects recombinants, maximum lod score Z = 6. 97 theta = 0. 00 00. The HaeIII polymorphism detected probe p5BE1. 2 gives maximum lod score Z = 2. 57 theta = 0. 00 00. Locus D11S325 gives lod score Z = 1. 53 theta = 0. 00 00. These data suggest locus aniridia (AN1) chromosome 2p misassigned autosomal dominant aniridia family segregating aniridia mutation linked markers 11p13 region. GT AT transition splice donor site causes skipping preceding exon phenylketonuria. Classical Phenylketonuria (PKU) autosomal recessive human genetic disorder caused deficiency hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). We isolated several mutant PAH cDNA clones PKU carrier individual showed contained internal 116 base pair deletion, corresponding precisely exon 12 human chromosomal PAH gene. The deletion causes synthesis truncated protein lacking C-terminal 52 amino acids. Gene transfer expression studies using mutant PAH cDNA indicated deletion abolishes PAH activity cell result protein instability. To determine molecular basis deletion, mutant chromosomal PAH gene isolated individual shown contain GT-- greater AT substitution 5 splice donor site intron 12. Thus, consequence splice donor site mutation human liver skipping preceding exon RNA splicing.. Clinical molecular genetic analysis 19 Wolfram syndrome kindreds demonstrating wide spectrum mutations WFS1. Wolfram syndrome autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder characterized juvenile-onset diabetes mellitus progressive optic atrophy. mtDNA deletions described, gene (WFS1) recently identified, chromosome 4p16, encoding predicted 890 amino acid transmembrane protein. Direct DNA sequencing done screen entire coding region WFS1 gene 30 patients 19 British kindreds Wolfram syndrome. DNA also screened structural rearrangements (deletions duplications) point mutations mtDNA. No pathogenic mtDNA mutations found cohort. We identified 24 mutations WFS1 gene 8 nonsense mutations, 8 missense mutations, 3 in-frame deletions, 1 in-frame insertion, 4 frameshift mutations. Of these, 23 novel mutations, occurred exon 8. The majority patients compound heterozygotes two mutations, common founder mutation. The data also analyzed genotype-phenotype relationships. Although interesting cases noted, consideration small sample size frequency mutation indicated clear-cut correlations observed mutations disease severity. There obvious mutation hot spots clusters. Hence, molecular screening Wolfram syndrome affected families Wolfram syndrome-carrier status subjects psychiatric disorders diabetes mellitus require complete analysis exon 8 upstream exons.. Maternal uniparental disomy chromosome 14 boy normal karyotype. We report boy maternal uniparental disomy chromosome 14 (UPD (14)). At 7 years age referred us paediatrician symptoms Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). He showed short stature, obesity, mild developmental delay, cryptorchidism, mild dysmorphic features. The history indicated intrauterine growth retardation end pregnancy. His mother 44 years age time birth. After birth showed hypotonia poor sucking, gavage feeding needed. Motor development delayed. After 1 year became obese despite normal appetite. Recurrent middle ear infections, high pain threshold, great skill jigsaw puzzles reported. There behavioural problems sleep disturbance. Chromosomal analysis normal (46, XY). DNA analysis Prader-Willi syndrome showed abnormalities. Two years later re-examined thought features fitted PWS-like phenotype associated maternal UPD (14). At time precocious puberty evident. DNA analysis showed maternal heterodisomy chromosome 14. In previously described 11 cases maternal UPD (14), Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14 detected cytogenetically DNA analysis. This first report diagnosis maternal UPD (14) based clinical features. This finding underlines importance DNA analysis maternal UPD (14) patients similar PWS-like phenotype even without previous identification Robertsonian translocation involving chromosome 14.. Detection eight BRCA1 mutations 10 breast/ovarian cancer families, including 1 family male breast cancer. Genetic epidemiological evidence suggests mutations BRCA1 may responsible approximately one half early onset familial breast cancer majority familial breast/ovarian cancer. The recent cloning BRCA1 allows direct detection mutations, feasibility presymptomatic screening cancer susceptibility unknown. We analyzed genomic DNA one affected individual 24 families least three cases ovarian breast cancer, using SSCP assays. Variant SSCP bands subcloned sequenced. Allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization used verify sequence changes screen DNA control individuals. Six frameshift two missense mutations detected 10 different families. A frameshift mutation detected male proband affected breast prostate cancer. A 40-bp deletion detected patient developed intra-abdominal carcinomatosis 1 year prophylactic oophorectomy. Mutations detected throughout gene, one detected single family. These results provide evidence inherited breast ovarian cancer occur consequence wide array BRCA1 mutations. These results suggests development screening test BRCA1 mutations technically challenging. The finding mutation family male breast cancer, previously thought related BRCA1, also illustrates potential difficulties genetic counseling individuals known carry mutations.. Color vision defects adrenomyeloneuropathy. The relationship abnormal color vision adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN) investigated 27 AMN patients 31 age-matched controls using Farnsworth-Munsell 100 Hue test. Twelve (44%) 27 patients showed test scores significantly normal. The axes bipolarity determined testing differed widely patients abnormal scores, compatible notion different alterations visual pigment genes occur different AMN kindreds. These observations confirm earlier impression frequency abnormal color vision increased kindreds, supports contentions (1) AMN (and companion, adrenoleukodystrophy) closely linked visual pigment loci Xq28 (2) proximity might provide opportunity observe contiguous gene defects.. Patterns exon deletions Duchenne Becker muscular dystrophy. A panel patients Duchenne Becker muscular dystrophy (DMD BMD) screened cDNA probes Cf56a Cf23a, detect exons central part DMD gene. One exons deleted 60% patients. The deletions mapped prove heterogeneous size extent, particularly DMD. Deletions specific DMD BMD described. Half BMD patients deletion one particular small group exons; smaller deletions within group produce severe DMD.. The LEC rat deletion copper transporting ATPase gene homologous Wilson disease gene. The Long-Evans Cinnamon (LEC) rat shows similarity Wilson disease many clinical biochemical features. We cloned cDNAs rat gene (Atp7b) homologous human Wilson disease gene (ATP7B) used identify partial deletion Atp7b gene LEC rat. The deletion removes least 900 bp coding region 3 end, includes crucial ATP binding domain extends downstream gene. Our results provide convincing evidence defining LEC rat animal model Wilson disease. This model important studying liver pathophysiology, developing therapy Wilson disease studying pathway copper transport possible interaction heavy metals.. Detection new submicroscopic Norrie disease deletion interval novel DNA probe isolated differential Alu PCR fingerprint cloning. Differential Alu PCR fingerprint cloning used isolate DNA probe Xp11. 4-- > p11. 21 region human X chromosome. This novel sequence, cpXr318 (DXS742), detects new submicroscopic deletion interval Norrie disease locus (NDP). Combining data consensus genetic map proximal short arm X chromosome, propose physical order Xcen-DXS14-DXS255- (DXS426, TIMP) - (DXS742- ([MAOB-MAOA-DXS7], NDP) -DXS77-DXS228) -DXS209-DXS148-DXS196- + + + Xpter. The cpXr318 probe subclone cosmid corresponding DXS7 locus converted sequence-tagged sites. Finally, DXS742, DSX7, DXS77, MAOA integrated physical map spanning Norrie disease locus Genetic analysis Japanese family normotriglyceridemic abetalipoproteinemia indicates lack linkage apolipoprotein B gene. Normotriglyceridemic abetalipoproteinemia rare familial disorder characterized isolated deficiency apoB-100. We previously reported patient disease, normal apoB-48 apoB-100. To elucidate genetic abnormalities family, studied linkage apoB gene using three genetic markers. The proband affected brother showed completely different apoB gene alleles, suggesting apoB gene related disorder family. By contrast, American case point substitution apoB gene generating in-frame stop codon. These results indicate disorder caused defect (s) either apoB gene genes.. Founder mutations BRCA1 gene Polish families breast-ovarian cancer. We undertaken hospital-based study, identify possible BRCA1 BRCA2 founder mutations Polish population. The study group consisted 66 Polish families cancer least three related females affected breast ovarian cancer cancer diagnosed, least one three affected females, age < 50 years. A total 26 families breast ovarian cancers, 4 families ovarian cancers only, 36 families breast cancers only. Genomic DNA prepared peripheral blood leukocytes least one affected woman family. The entire coding region BRCA1 BRCA2 screened presence germline mutations, use SSCP followed direct sequencing observed variants. Mutations found 35 (53%) 66 families studied. All one mutations detected within BRCA1 gene. BRCA1 abnormalities identified four families ovarian cancer only, 67% 27 families breast ovarian cancer, 34% 35 families breast cancer only. The single family BRCA2 mutation breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. Seven distinct mutations identified; five occurred two families. In total, recurrent mutations found 33 (94%) 35 families detected mutations. Three BRCA1 abnormalities - 5382insC, C61G, 4153delA - accounted 51%, 20%, 11% identified mutations, respectively.. New founder haplotypes myotonic dystrophy locus southern Africa. The association normal alleles CTG repeat two nearby polymorphisms myotonin protein kinase gene, Alu insertion/deletion polymorphism myotonic dystrophy kinase (DMK) (G/T) intron 9/HinfI polymorphism, analyzed South African Negroids, population myotonic dystrophy (DM) described. South African Negroids CTG allelic distribution significantly different Caucasoids Japanese CTG repeat lengths > = 19 rare. The striking linkage disequilibrium specific alleles Alu polymorphism (Alu (ins) Alu (del)), HinfI polymorphism (HinfI-1 HinfI-2), CTG repeat polymorphism seen Caucasoid (Europeans Canadians) populations also found South African Negroid population. Numerous haplotypes, previously described Europeans, were, however, found. It thus seems likely small number " African " chromosomes present progenitors non-African peoples. These data provide support " Africa " model origin modern humans suggest rare ancestral DM mutation event may occurred migration Africa, hence absence DM sub-Saharan Negroid peoples.. Marked phenotypic heterogeneity associated expansion CAG repeat sequence spinocerebellar ataxia 3/Machado-Joseph disease locus. The spinocerebellar ataxia 3 locus (SCA3) type I autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA type I), clinically genetically heterogeneous group neurodegenerative disorders, mapped chromosome 14q32. 1 1. ADCA type I patients families segregating SCA3 share clinical features common Machado-Joseph disease (MJD), gene maps region. We show disease gene segregating three French ADCA type I kindreds French family neuropathological findings suggesting ataxochoreic form dentatorubropallidoluysian atrophy carries expanded CAG repeat sequence located locus MJD. Analysis mutation families shows strong negative correlation size expanded CAG repeat age onset clinical disease. Instability expanded triplet repeat found affected sex parent transmitting mutation. Evidence found somatic gonadal mosaicism alleles carrying expanded trinucleotide repeats. The red-green visual pigment gene region adrenoleukodystrophy. Although recent data established specific very-long-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase defective X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD), ALD gene still unidentified. The ALD locus mapped Xq28, like red green color pigment genes. Abnormal color vision observed 12 27 patients adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), milder form ALD. Furthermore, rearrangements color vision gene cluster found four eight ALD kindreds. This led us propose single DNA rearrangement could underlie ALD abnormal color vision patients. Study 34 French ALD patients failed reveal higher expected frequency green/red visual pigment rearrangements 3 red/green color vision gene complex. The previous report rearrangements based small numbers lack knowledge frequency " abnormal " color vision arrays molecular analysis twice high expected basis frequency phenotypic color vision defects. The red/green color pigment (R/GCP) region studied pulsed-field gel electrophoresis 14 patients, find fragment size difference patients normal individuals number pigment genes. The R/GCP region also analyzed 29 French seven North American ALD patients using six genomic DNA probes, isolated cosmid walk, flank color vision genes. No deletions found probes lie 3 green pigment genes. One eight previously reported ALD individuals long deletion 5 red pigment gene, deletion causing blue cone monochromacy. This finding previous findings 45% frequency phenotypic color vision defects patients AMN may suggest ALD/AMN gene lies 5 red pigment gene frequent phenotypic color vision anomalies owe origin deleted DNA includes regulatory genes color vision. It possible, however, phenotypic color vision anomalies AMN may phenocopies secondary retinal neural involvement disease. The single case blue cone monochromacy may therefore fortuitous coincidence two diseases.. Haim-Munk syndrome Papillon-Lefevre syndrome allelic mutations cathepsin C. Of many palmoplantar keratoderma (PPK) conditions, Papillon-Lefevre syndrome (PLS) Haim-Munk syndrome (HMS) associated premature periodontal destruction. Although PLS HMS share cardinal features PPK severe periodontitis, number additional findings reported HMS including arachnodactyly, acro-osteolysis, atrophic changes nails, radiographic deformity fingers. While PLS cases identified throughout world, HMS described among descendants religious isolate originally Cochin, India. Parental consanguinity characteristic many cases conditions. Although autosomal recessive transmission PLS evident, " complex " autosomal recessive pattern inheritance phenotypic influences closely linked modifying locus hypothesised HMS. Recently, mutations cathepsin C gene identified underlying genetic defect PLS. To determine cathepsin C mutation also responsible HMS, sequenced gene affected unaffected subjects Cochin isolate PLS HMS phenotypes appear. Here report identification mutation cathepsin C (exon 6, 2127A-- > G) changes highly conserved amino acid cathepsin C peptide. This mutation segregates HMS four nuclear families. Additionally, existence shared common haplotype genetic loci flanking cathepsin C gene suggests affected subjects descended Cochin isolate homozygous mutation inherited " identical descent " common ancestor. This finding supports simple autosomal recessive inheritance HMS families. We also report mutation exon 6 CTSC codon (2126C-- > T) Turkish family classical PLS. These findings provide evidence PLS HMS allelic variants cathepsin C gene mutations.. X inactivation somatic cell selection rescue female mice carrying Piga-null mutation. A somatic mutation X linked PIGA gene responsible deficiency glycosyl phosphatidylinositol (GPI) -anchored proteins blood cells patients paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria. No inherited form GPI-anchor deficiency described. Because conventional Piga gene knockout associated high embryonic lethality chimeric mice, used Cre/loxP system. We generated mice two loxP sites flank part Piga exon 2. After crossbreeding female mice EIIa-cre strain, floxed allele undergoes Cre-mediated recombination high efficiency early embryonic development. Because X chromosome inactivation, female offspring mosaic cells express lack GPI-linked proteins. Analysis mosaic mice showed heart, lung, kidney, brain, liver, mainly wild-type Piga active, suggesting tissues require GPI-linked proteins.

Molecular genetics glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) Mediterranean variant description new G6PD mutant, G6PD Andalus1361A. Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD; E. C. 1. 1. 1. 49) deficiency common human enzymopathy; 300 different biochemical variants enzyme described. In many parts world Mediterranean type G6PD deficiency prevalent. However, G6PD Mediterranean come regarded generic term applied similar G6PD mutations thought, however, represent somewhat heterogeneous group. A C----T mutation nucleotide 563 G6PD Mediterranean identified Vulliamy et al., mutation found De Vita et al. G6PD Mediterranean, G6PD Sassari, G6PD Cagliari. The latter subjects additional mutation, nucleotide 1311, produce coding change. We examined genomic DNA five patients--four Spanish origin one Jewish origin--having enzymatically documented G6PD Mediterranean. All mutation nucleotide 563 nucleotide 1311. A sixth sample, resembling G6PD Mediterranean kinetically slightly rapid electrophoretic mobility, designated G6PD Andalus found different mutation, G----A transition nucleotide 1361, producing arginine-to-histidine substitution. These studies suggest G6PD Mediterranean is, all, relatively homogeneous. Small nuclear ribonucleoprotein polypeptide N (SNRPN), expressed gene Prader-Willi syndrome critical region. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) associated paternally derived chromosomal deletions region 15q11-13 maternal disomy chromosome 15. Therefore, loss expressed paternal alleles maternally imprinted genes must responsible PWS phenotype. We mapped gene encoding small nuclear RNA associated polypeptide SmN (SNRPN) human chromosome 15q12 processed pseudogene SNRPNP1 chromosome region 6pter-p21. Furthermore, SNRPN mapped minimal deletion interval critical PWS. The fact mouse Snrpn gene maternally imprinted brain suggests loss paternally derived SNRPN allele may involved PWS phenotype..

The BRCA1 region also subject allelic loss sporadic breast ovarian cancers, indication BRCA1 mutations may occur somatically tumors. The BRCA1 coding region examined mutations primary breast ovarian tumors show allele loss BRCA1 locus. Mutations detected 3 32 breast 1 12 ovarian carcinomas; four mutations germline alterations occurred early-onset cancers. These results suggest mutation BRCA1 may critical development majority breast ovarian cancers arise absence mutant germline allele.. Genomic structure EWS gene relationship EWSR1, site tumor-associated chromosome translocation. The EWS gene identified based location chromosome 22 breakpoint (11; 22) (q24; q12) translocation characterizes Ewing sarcoma related neuroectodermal tumors. The EWS gene spans 40 kb DNA encoded 17 exons. The nucleotide sequence exons identical previously described cDNA. The first 7 exons encode N-terminal domain EWS, consists repeated degenerated polypeptide 7 12 residues rich tyrosine, serine, threonine, glycine, glutamine. Exons 11, 12, 13 encode putative RNA binding domain. The three glycine- arginine-rich motifs gene mainly encoded exons 8-9, 14, 16. The DNA sequence 5 region gene features CpG-rich island lacks canonical promoter elements, TATA CCAAT consensus sequences. Positions chromosome 22 breakpoints determined 19 Ewing tumors. They localized introns 7 8 18 cases intron 10 1 case.. PAX6 mutations aniridia. Aniridia congenital malformation eye, chiefly characterised iris hypoplasia, cause blindness. The PAX6 gene isolated candidate aniridia gene positional cloning smallest region overlap aniridia-associated deletions. Subsequently PAX6 intragenic mutations demonstrated Smalleye, mouse mutant animal model aniridia, six human aniridia patients. In paper describe four additional PAX6 point mutations aniridia patients, sporadic familial. These mutations highlight regions gene essential normal PAX6 function. In addition, frequency found PAX6 mutations suggests lesions PAX6 account cases aniridia.. Mutations PAX6 gene patients hereditary aniridia. The 14 exons PAX6 gene analysed exon-by-exon using SSCP 6 aniridia families. In family band shifts observed SSCP gels one exon direct PCR-sequencing revealed mutations case. Two mutations involved C-- > T transitions CGAarg codons exons 9 11. Another C-- > T transition converted CAG-glutamine TAG-stop exon 7. Small insertions created frameshifts produced downstream stop codons another two patients A-- > T mutation disrupted splice donor site exon 5 remaining family. Thus, complete inactivation PAX6 gene predicted cases. Analysis affected members families showed that, case, affected individuals carried family-specific mutation. One polymorphism found exon 7. This data strongly supports candidature PAX6 gene responsible hereditary aniridia.. Locus heterogeneity Friedreich ataxia. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) common form autosomal recessive ataxia. The disease locus assigned chromosome 9 disease gene, STM7/X25, isolated. To date data suggest locus homogeneity FRDA. We provide strong evidence second FRDA locus. Studying two siblings FRDA two families detect mutation STM7/X25. Haplotype analysis STM7/X25 region chromosome 9 demonstrated relevant portion chromosome 9 differs patients. Although patients studied typical FRDA, one sibpair uncommon symptom retained tendon reflexes. In order investigate whether retained tendon reflexes characteristic FRDA caused second locus, FRDA2, studied unrelated FRDA patient retained tendon reflexes. The observation typical mutations STM7/X25 (GAA expansions) patient demonstrates two genetically different forms FRDA cannot distinguished clinically.. Haploinsufficiency transcription factors FOXC1 FOXC2 results aberrant ocular development. Anterior segment developmental disorders, including Axenfeld-Rieger anomaly (ARA), variably associate harmfully elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), causes glaucoma. Clinically observed dysgenesis correlate IOP, however, etiology glaucoma development understood. The forkhead transcription factor genes Foxc1 (formerly Mf1) Foxc2 (formerly Mfh1) expressed mesenchyme ocular drainage structures derive. Mutations human homolog Foxc1, FKHL7, cause dominant anterior segment defects glaucoma various families. We show Foxc1 (+/-) mice anterior segment abnormalities similar reported human patients. These abnormalities include small absent Schlemms canal, aberrantly developed trabecular meshwork, iris hypoplasia, severely eccentric pupils displaced Schwalbes line. The penetrance clinically obvious abnormalities varies genetic background. In affected eyes, collagen bundles half normal diameter, collagen elastic tissue sparse. Thus, abnormalities extracellular matrix synthesis organization may contribute development ocular phenotypes. Despite abnormalities ocular drainage structures Foxc1 (+/-) mice, IOP normal almost mice analyzed, genetic backgrounds ages. Similar abnormalities found Foxc2 (+/-) mice, disease-associated mutations identified human homolog FKHL14 32 ARA patients. Foxc1 (+/-) Foxc2 (+/-) mice useful models studying anterior segment development anomalies, may allow identification genes interact Foxc1 Foxc2 (or FKHL7 FKHL14) produce phenotype elevated IOP glaucoma.. The dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans-associated collagen type Ialpha1/platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain fusion gene generates transforming protein processed functional PDGF-BB. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) displays chromosomal rearrangements involving chromosome 17 22, fuse collagen type Ialpha1 (COLIA1) gene platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) B-chain (PDGFB) gene. To characterize functional structural properties COLIA1/PDGFB fusion protein, generated stable NIH3T3 cell line contained tumor-derived chimeric gene resulting COIA1 intron 7-PDGFB intron 1 fusion. Expression fusion protein led morphological transformation increased growth rate cells. The PDGF receptor kinase inhibitor CGP57148B reversed transformed phenotype reduced growth rate COLIA1/PDGFB-expressing cells effects control cells. The presence dimeric COLIA1/PDGFB precursors demonstrated PDGFB immunoprecipitations metabolically labeled cells also PDGFB immunoprecipitations followed immunoblotting COLIA1 antibodies. Pulse-chase studies demonstrated COLIA1/PDGFB precursor processed end product indistinguishable wild-type PDGF-BB. Finally, COLIA1/PDGFB-expressing cells generated tumors s. c c. injection nude mice, tumor growth reduced treatment CGP57148B. We conclude COLIA1/PDGFB fusion associated DFSP contributes tumor development ectopic production PDGF-BB formation autocrine loop. Our findings, thus, suggest PDGF receptors could target pharmacological treatment DFSP giant cell fibroblastoma, e. g., use PDGF receptor kinase inhibitors CGP57148B.

A G-to-C transition second base codon 413 exon 12 gene results substitution Pro413 Arg413 mutant protein. This mutation (R413P) results negligible enzymatic activity expressed heterologous mammalian cells compatible classic PKU phenotype patient. Population genetic studies reveal mutation tightly linked restriction fragment length polymorphism haplotype 4, predominant haplotype PAH locus Oriental population. It accounts 13. 8% northern Chinese 27% Japanese PKU alleles, rare southern Chinese (2. 2%) absent Caucasian population. The data demonstrate unambiguously mutation occurred racial divergence Orientals Caucasians suggest allele spread throughout Orient founder effect. Previous protein polymorphism studies eastern Asia led hypothesis " northern Mongoloids " represented founding population Asia. Our results compatible hypothesis PKU mutation might occurred northern Mongoloids subsequently spread Chinese Japanese populations. Late-onset familial Mediterranean fever (FMF): subset distinct clinical, demographic, molecular genetic characteristics. To determine prevalence characterize demographic, clinical, genetic features familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) late onset, patients experiencing first FMF attack age 40 years identified using computerized registry FMF clinic, thoroughly interviewed examined. The control group consisted 40 consecutive FMF patients, arrived FMF clinic regular follow-up visit 40 years age older time examination. The severity disease patients controls determined using modified score, developed previously. Mutational analysis FMF gene performed using commercial kit. Only 20 4000 (0. 5%) patients late-onset FMF. These patients mostly men, non-North African origin, P < 0. 05 compared controls. All abdominal attacks manifestation disease, P < 0. 001 001. None chronic prolonged manifestations FMF, example, amyloidosis, chronic arthritis, protracted myalgia, P < 0. 001. The response treatment good despite using low colchicine dose, P < 0. 05. The overall severity score indicated mild disease, P < 0. 001. Mutational analysis revealed absence M694V homozygosity, P < 0. 01, compared regular FMF population. We conclude onset FMF late age defines milder form disease typical clinical, demographic, molecular genetic characteristics Structure human Na+/glucose cotransporter gene SGLT1. Intestinal uptake dietary glucose galactose mediated SGLT1 Na +/glucose cotransporter brush border. An SGLT1 missense mutation underlies hereditary glucose/galactose malabsorption, characterized potentially fatal diarrhea; conversely, oral rehydration therapy exploits normal transport alleviate life-threatening diarrhea infectious origin. We mapped entire human SGLT1 Na +/glucose cotransporter gene cosmid lambda phage clones representing genomic region 112 kilobases. Transcription initiation occurred site 27 base pairs 3 TATAA sequence. All exon-flanking regions sequenced, entire 112-kilobase region mapped four restriction enzymes. SGLT1 comprised 15 exons (spanning 72 kilobases); possible evolutionary origin six-membrane-span ancestral precursor via gene duplication event suggested comparison exons protein secondary structure sequence considerations. A new missense mutation exon 1 causing glucose/galactose malabsorption also described. This first Na (+) -dependent cotransporter gene structure reported. These data facilitate search new glucose/galactose malabsorption-related mutations important gene provide basis future evolutionary comparisons Na (+) -dependent cotransporters.. ATM phosphorylates p95/nbs1 S-phase checkpoint pathway. The rare diseases ataxia-telangiectasia (AT), caused mutations ATM gene, Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), mutations p95/nbs1 gene, share variety phenotypic abnormalities chromosomal instability, radiation sensitivity defects cell-cycle checkpoints response ionizing radiation. The ATM gene encodes protein kinase activated ionizing radiation radiomimetic drugs, whereas p95/nbs1 part protein complex involved responses DNA double-strand breaks. Here, similarities AT NBS, evaluated functional interactions ATM p95/nbs1. Activation ATM kinase ionizing radiation induction ATM-dependent responses NBS cells indicated p95/nbs1 may required signalling ATM ionizing radiation. However, p95/nbs1 phosphorylated serine 343 ATM-dependent manner vitro vivo ionizing radiation. A p95/nbs1 construct mutated ATM phosphorylation site abrogated S-phase checkpoint induced ionizing radiation normal cells failed compensate functional deficiency NBS cells. These observations link ATM p95/nbs1 common signalling pathway provide explanation phenotypic similarities two diseases.. Two distinct mutations single BamHI site phenylketonuria. Classical phenylketonuria autosomal recessive disease caused deficiency hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The abolition invariant BamHI site located coding sequence PAH gene (exon 7) led recognition two new point mutations codon 272 273 (272gly----stop 273ser----phe, respectively). Both mutations detected north eastern France Belgium occurred background RFLP haplotype 7 alleles. The present study supports view clinical heterogeneity PKU accounted large variety mutant genotypes associated PAH deficiencies.. Functional link ataxia-telangiectasia Nijmegen breakage syndrome gene products. Ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS) recessive genetic disorders susceptibility cancer similar cellular phenotypes. The protein product gene responsible A-T, designated ATM, member family kinases characterized carboxy-terminal phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-like domain. The NBS1 protein specifically mutated patients Nijmegen breakage syndrome forms complex DNA repair proteins Rad50 Mrel1. Here show phosphorylation NBS1, induced ionizing radiation, requires catalytically active ATM. Complexes containing ATM NBS1 exist vivo untreated cells cells treated ionizing radiation. We identified two residues NBS1, Ser 278 Ser 343 phosphorylated vitro ATM whose modification vivo essential cellular response DNA damage. This response includes S-phase checkpoint activation, formation NBS1/Mrel1/Rad50 nuclear foci rescue hypersensitivity ionizing radiation. Together, results demonstrate biochemical link cell-cycle checkpoints activated DNA damage DNA repair two genetic diseases overlapping phenotypes.. Structure genomic sequence myotonic dystrophy (DM kinase) gene. The mutation causing myotonic dystrophy (DM) recently identified unstable CTG trinucleotide repeat located 3 untranslated region gene encoding protein putative serine-threonine protein kinase activity. In report present genomic sequences human murine DM kinase gene. A comparison sequences known cDNA sequences species, led us predict translation initiation codon, well determine organization DM kinase gene. Several polymorphisms within human DM kinase gene identified, PCR assays detect two described. The complete sequence characterization structure DM kinase gene, well identification novel polymorphisms within gene, represent important step understanding genetics myotonic dystrophy molecular biology gene.. Identification novel imprinted transcripts Prader-Willi syndrome Angelman syndrome deletion region: evidence regional imprinting control. Deletions abnormalities human chromosome 15q11-q13 associated two developmental disorders, Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) Angelman syndrome (AS). Loss expression imprinted, paternally expressed genes implicated PWS. However, number imprinted genes contribute PWS, range imprinting signal acts silence one copy gene parent-of-origin-specific manner, unknown. To identify additional imprinted genes could contribute PWS phenotype understand regional control imprinting 15q11-q13, constructed imprinted transcript map PWS-AS deletion interval. The imprinting status 22 expressed sequence tags derived radiation-hybrid human transcript maps physical maps determined reverse transcriptase-PCR assay correlated position transcripts physical map. Seven new paternally expressed transcripts localize approximately 1. 5-Mb domain surrounding SNRPN-associated imprinting center, already includes four imprinted, paternally expressed genes. All tested new transcripts deletion region expressed alleles. A domain exclusive paternal expression surrounding imprinting center suggests strong regional control imprinting process. This study provides means investigation additional genes cause modify phenotypes associated rearrangements 15q11-q13. Penetrances BRCA1 1675delA 1135insA respect breast cancer ovarian cancer. For genetic counseling predictive testing families inherited breast-ovarian cancer, penetrances expressions underlying mutations known. We previously reported two BRCA1 founder mutations Norwegian population. Index cases present study found two different ways series consecutive ovarian cancers (n = 16) family cancer clinic (n = 14). Altogether, 20 patients BRCA1 1675delA, 10 1135insA. Their relatives described respect absence/presence breast and/or ovarian cancer. Of 133 living female relatives, 83 (62%) tested presence mutation. No difference, penetrance expression, two mutations found, whereas differences according method ascertainment seen. The overall findings disease started occur age 30 years age 50 years 48% mutation-carrying women experienced breast and/or ovarian cancer. More ovarian cancers breast cancers recorded. Both penetrance expression (breast cancer vs. ovarian cancer) different reports Ashkenazi founder mutations. Whether reported differences reflect true differences and/or methodological problems discussed. An observed excess mutation carriers could accounted methodological problems; possible explanations " true " low penetrance preferential segregation.. Molecular basis subtotal complement C6 deficiency. A carboxy-terminally truncated functionally active C6. Individuals subtotal complement C6 deficiency possess C6 molecule 14% shorter normal C6 present low detectable concentrations (1-2% normal mean). We show dysmorphic C6 bactericidally active lacks epitope mapped carboxy-terminal part C6 using C6 cDNA fragments expressed fusion proteins pUEX expression system. We thus predicted abnormal C6 molecule might carboxy-terminally truncated sought mutation area approximately 14% carboxy-terminal end coding sequence. By sequencing PCR-amplified products region, found, three individuals two families, mutation might plausibly responsible defect. All three abnormal 5 splice donor site intron 15, would probably prevent splicing. An in-frame stop codon found 17 codons downstream intron boundary, would lead truncated polypeptide 13. 5% smaller normal C6. This result unexpected, earlier studies mapped C5b binding site, putative enzymatic region, part C6. Interestingly, three subjects probably heterozygous subtotal C6 complete C6 deficiency. Mutations VHL gene sporadic renal cell carcinoma: definition risk factor VHL patients develop RCC. To investigate nature somatic von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) mutations, analyzed 173 primary sporadic human renal cell carcinomas mutations VHL tumor suppressor gene, using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) single-strand conformational polymorphism analysis (SSCP) DNA. We detected abnormal SSCP pattern 73 samples. After sequencing, identified microdeletions 58% cases, microinsertions 17%, nonsense mutations 8%, missense mutations 17%. Among mutations, 50% correspond new mutations. VHL mutations found nonpapillary renal cell carcinoma (RCC) subtype, previously reported. To compare somatic germline mutations, used VHL database, includes 507 mutations. The study mutational events revealed significant difference somatic germline mutations mutations leading truncated proteins observed 78% somatic mutations vs 37% germline mutations (P < 0. 001). We postulated specific pattern VHL mutations associated sporadic RCC. This pattern corresponds mutations leading mainly truncated proteins specific missense mutations. We analyzed occurrence RCC VHL families, based nature mutations. We observed RCC least one member VHL families 77% cases mutations leading truncated proteins versus 55% cases missense mutations (P < 0. 05). Thus, mutations resulting truncated proteins may lead higher risk RCC VHL patients Evidence inter-generational instability CAG repeat MJD1 gene conserved haplotypes flanking markers amongst Japanese Caucasian subjects Machado-Joseph disease. The size (CAG)n repeat array 3' end MJD1 gene haplotype series microsatellite markers surrounding MJD1 gene examined large cohort Japanese Caucasian subjects affected Machado-Joseph disease (MJD). Our data provide five novel observations. First, MJD associated expansion fo array normal range 14-37 repeats 68-84 repeats Japanese Caucasian subjects, subjects observed expansions intermediate size normal MJD affected groups. Second, expanded allele associated MJD displays inter-generational instability, particularly male meioses, instability associated clinical phenomenon anticipation. Third, size expanded allele inversely correlated age-of-onset MJD (r = -0.738, p < 0.001), also correlated frequency clinical features [e.g. pseudoexophthalmos pyramidal signs frequent subjects large repeats (p < 0.001 p < 0.05 respectively)]. Fourth, disease phenotype significantly severe early age onset (16 years) subject homozygous expanded allele, contrasts Huntington disease suggests expanded allele MJD1 gene could exert effect either dominant negative effect (putatively excluded HD) gain function effect proposed HD. Finally, Japanese Caucasian subjects affected MJD share haplotypes several markers surrounding MJD1 gene, uncommon normal Japanese Caucasian population, suggests existence either common founders populations chromosomes susceptible pathologic expansion CAG repeat MJD1 gene. Myotonic dystrophy: role CUG triplet repeats splicing novel DMPK exon altered cytoplasmic DMPK mRNA isoform ratios. The mechanism (CTG) n expansion 3 UTR DMPK gene causes myotonic dystrophy (DM) unknown. We identified four RNA splicing factors--hnRNP C, U2AF (U2 auxiliary factor), PTB (polypyrimidine tract binding protein), PSF (PTB associated splicing factor) --that bind two short regions 3 (CUG) n, found novel 3 DMPK exon resulting mRNA lacking repeats. We propose (CUG) n essential cis acting element splicing event. In contrast (CUG) n containing mRNAs, novel isoform retained nucleus DM cells, resulting imbalances relative levels cytoplasmic DMPK mRNA isoforms new dominant effect mutation DMPK.. Mechanism increased iron absorption murine model hereditary hemochromatosis : increased duodenal expression iron transporter DMT1. Hereditary hemochromatosis (HH) common autosomal recessive disorder characterized tissue iron deposition secondary excessive dietary iron absorption. We recently reported HFE, protein defective HH, physically associated transferrin receptor (TfR) duodenal crypt cells proposed mutations HFE attenuate uptake transferrin-bound iron plasma duodenal crypt cells, leading up-regulation transporters dietary iron. Here, tested hypothesis HFE-/- mice increased duodenal expression divalent metal transporter (DMT1). By 4 weeks age, HFE-/- mice demonstrated iron loading compared HFE +/+ littermates, elevated transferrin saturations (68. 4% vs. 49. 8%) elevated liver iron concentrations (985 micrograms vs. 381 micrograms). By using Northern blot analyses, quantitated duodenal expression classes DMT1 transcripts one containing iron responsive element (IRE), called DMT1 (IRE), one containing IRE, called DMT1 (non-IRE). The positive control DMT1 up-regulation murine model dietary iron deficiency demonstrated greatly increased levels duodenal DMT1 (IRE) mRNA. HFE-/- mice also demonstrated increase duodenal DMT1 (IRE) mRNA (average 7. 7-fold), despite elevated transferrin saturation hepatic iron content. Duodenal expression DMT1 (non-IRE) increased, hepatic expression DMT1 increased. These data support model HH HFE mutations lead inappropriately low crypt cell iron, resultant stabilization DMT1 (IRE) mRNA, up-regulation DMT1, increased absorption dietary iron. Yeast artificial chromosomes molecular analysis familial polyposis APC gene region. Two yeast artificial chromosomes (YACs) spanning total distance 1. 1 megabase pairs DNA around MCC (for mutated colorectal carcinoma) APC (for adenomatous polyposis coli) genes 5q21 isolated characterized. Starting MCC gene, strategy undertaken identify constitutional submicroscopic deletions familial adenomatous polyposis patients might considerably narrow position APC gene. To end, YACs identified MCC gene screened across chromosome 5-specific cosmid library provide source DNA probes genomic scanning. The cosmids isolated experiments used screen panel somatic cell hybrids containing chromosome 5 segregated patients suspected carry putative interstitial deletions. This screening approach led confirmation small heterozygous deletion polyposis patient overlaps one two isolated YACs. This YAC shown contain entire APC gene, addition significant portion DNA flanking 5 end gene, therefore prove valuable resource functional studies transfer colorectal tumor-derived cell lines. Analbuminemia American Indian girl. Analbuminemia fortuitously detected nonedematous 12-year-old American Indian girl atopic dermatitis, mild bronchial asthma, mild seizure disorder, hyperlipoproteinemia corneal arcus. Immunologic methods revealed trace amounts (17 mg/100 ml) apparently normal serum albumin. The patients parents remotely related. The pedigree clinical findings compatible autosomal recessive transmission analbuminemia. Heterozygotes subnormal levels serum albumin. The Gc-locus closely linked structural albumin locus. Gc-protein levels normal patient together normal chromosomal banding studies make unlikely chromosomal deletion caused analbuminemia. Gc-types family compatible with, prove, linkage analbuminemia Gc-locus. These findings suggest " thalassemia " -like mutation disorder.. Treatment Duchenne muscular dystrophy growth hormone inhibitors. A controlled, double-blind therapeutic trial drug mazindol, growth hormone inhibitor, performed pair 7 1/2 year-old monozygotic twins, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The rationale trial based patient (reported previously) affected simultaneously DMD growth hormone (GH) deficiency, showing benign course dystrophic process still walking 18 years. One twins received 2 mg mazindol daily, received placebo. The assessment, repeated every 2 months, included weight height measurements, functional motor ability tests, ergometry determinations serum enzymes GH levels. After one year trial code broken seen twin placebo treatment strikingly worse brother, progression whose condition practically arrested. These results strongly suggest treatment GH inhibitor beneficial DMD patients.. Identification WASP mutations patients Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome isolated thrombocytopenia reveals allelic heterogeneity WAS locus. Mutation gene encoding recently isolated WASP protein identified genetic defect responsible X-linked Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS), primary immunodeficiency disease associated extensive phenotypic variability. To elucidate range WASP mutations responsible WAS, used PCR-SSCP analysis screen WASP gene mutation 19 unrelated boys diagnosis classical attenuated WAS isolated thrombocytopenia. All 19 patients WASP mutations, localized initial three terminal three exons gene, majority unique case. However, missense mutation results substitution arginine WAS codon 86 identified three boys severe WAS well one boy presenting thrombocytopenia alone. While three mutations found isolated thrombocytopenia patients leave reading frame intact, one-half gene alterations detected severe attenuated WAS patients result frameshifted transcript premature translation termination. These findings therefore confirm association WAS WASP mutation identify WASP mutation cause isolated congenital thrombocytopenia males. While WASP gene defects responsible isolated thrombocytopenia mild presentations WAS appear distinct resulting severe WAS, data indicate analysis WASP gene mutation provides valuable tool distinguishing spectrum WAS patients subset males isolated thrombocytopenia represent mild cases WAS.. Huntington disease without CAG expansion: phenocopies errors assignment? Huntington disease (HD) shown associated expanded CAG repeat within novel gene 4p16. 3 (IT15). A total 30 1, 022 affected persons (2. 9% cohort) expanded CAG disease range. The reasons observing expansion affected individuals important determining sensitivity using repeat length diagnosis affected patients predictive testing programs may biological relevance understanding molecular mechanism underlying HD. Here show majority (18) individuals normal sized alleles represent misdiagnosis, sample mix-up, clerical error. The remaining 12 patients represent possible phenocopies HD. In least four cases, family studies phenocopies excluded 4p16. 3 region responsible phenotype. Mutations HD gene CAG expansion excluded remaining eight cases; however, many seven persons, retrospective review patients clinical features identified characteristics typical HD. This study shows rare occasions mutations other, as-yet-undefined genes present clinical phenotype similar HD Allelic exclusion glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase platelets T lymphocytes Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome carrier. An obligate carrier Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) also heterozygous A B types X-linked glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase found. With became possible determine whether allelic exclusion occurs particular cell-types WAS carrier. If so, remaining cells particular cell-type would express normal X chromosome one glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase isoenzyme would demonstrable. This carrier B isoenzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase platelets thymus-derived T lymphocytes, although isoenzymes A B present erythrocytes neutrophils. These findings suggest selection WAS gene occurs platelets thymus-derived T lymphocytes defects associated WAS expressed cell-types may implicated genesis Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.. A novel mutation sodium/iodide symporter gene largest family iodide transport defect. We previously reported nine children autosomally recessive form congenital hypothyroidism due iodide transport defect large Hutterite family extensive consanguinity living central Canada. Since original report, diagnosed congenital hypothyroidism newborn TSH screening 9 additional children family. We performed direct sequencing PCR products NIS (sodium/iodide symporter) gene exon flanking introns amplified genomic DNA extracted peripheral blood cells patients. We identified novel NIS gene mutation, G395R (Gly395-- > Arg; GGA-- > AGA), 10 patients examined present study. All parents tested heterozygous mutation, suggesting patients homozygous.

The EWS gene, involved Ewing family tumors, malignant melanoma soft parts desmoplastic small round cell tumors, codes RNA binding protein novel regulatory domains. The EWS gene, maps band q12 human chromosome 22, involved wide variety human solid tumors including Ewing sarcoma, related primitive neuroectodermal tumors, malignant melanoma soft parts desmoplastic small round cell tumors. In tumors, EWS fused genes encoding transcriptional activators/repressors, like Fli-1 erg ATF 1 wt1. To better understand function EWS protein, cloned EWS cDNA. Sequence analysis cDNA revealed differential splicing involving two exons encoding 72 amino acids. Both alternatively spliced transcripts, EWS EWS-b, expressed variety cells. Because EWS proteins contain putative conserved RNA binding motifs, studied RNA binding properties EWS protein. The EWS-b protein binds RNA vitro and, specifically, poly G poly U. The RNA binding activity localized carboxy terminal 86 amino acids, constitute RGG box. Thus amino terminal domain EWS (NTD-EWS), involved chromosome translocation may regulate specificity RNA binding activity EWS. An EWS-erg chimeric protein, found Ewings sarcoma cells, functions transcriptional activator. Mutational analysis EWS-erg chimeric protein revealed NTD-EWS functions regulatory domain transcriptional activation properties EWS-erg chimeric protein..

Centrosome amplification defective G2-M cell cycle checkpoint induce genetic instability BRCA1 exon 11 isoform-deficient cells. Germline mutations Brca1 tumor suppressor gene predispose women breast ovarian cancers. To study mechanisms underlying BRCA1-related tumorigenesis, derived mouse embryonic fibroblast cells carrying targeted deletion exon 11 Brca1 gene. We show mutant cells maintain intact G1-S cell cycle checkpoint proliferate poorly. However, defective G2-M checkpoint cells accompanied extensive chromosomal abnormalities. Mutant fibroblasts contain multiple, functional centrosomes, lead unequal chromosome segregation, abnormal nuclear division, aneuploidy. These data uncover essential role BRCA1 maintaining genetic stability regulation centrosome duplication G2-M checkpoint provide molecular basis role BRCA1 tumorigenesis.. Aberrant splicing phenylalanine hydroxylase mRNA: major cause phenylketonuria parts southern Europe. We report mutation within phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene causes aberrant splicing mRNA tight association chromosomal haplotypes 6, 10, 36. Because high frequency particular haplotypes Bulgaria, Italy, Turkey, appears one frequent defects PAH gene causing classical phenylketonuria part Europe. The mutation G A transition position 546 intron 10 PAH gene, 11 bp upstream intron 10/exon 11 boundary. It activates cryptic splice site results in-frame insertion 9 nucleotides exon 10 exon 11 processed mRNA. Normal amounts liver PAH protein present homozygous patients, catalytic activity detected. This loss enzyme activity probably caused conformational changes resulting insertion three additional amino acids (Gly-Leu-Gln) normal sequences encoded exon 10 exon 11.. Biochemical structural analysis missense mutations N-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase causing mucopolysaccharidosis IVA phenotypes. Mucopolysaccharidosis IVA (MPS IVA; OMIM # 253000), lysosomal storage disorder caused deficiency N -acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfate sulfatase (GALNS), variable clinical phenotypes. To date identified 65 missense mutations GALNS gene MPS IVA patients, correlation genotype phenotype remained unclear. We studied 17 missense mutations using biochemical approaches 32 missense mutations, using structural analyses. Fifteen missense mutations two newly engineered active site mutations (C79S, C79T) characterized transient expression analysis. Mutant proteins, except C79S C79T, destabilized detected insoluble precursor forms C79S C79T mutants soluble mature size. Mutants found severe phenotype activity. Mutants found mild phenotype considerable residual activity (1. 3-13. 3% wild-type GALNS activity). Sulfatases, including GALNS, members highly conserved gene family sharing extensive sequence homology. Thus, tertiary structural model human GALNS constructed X-ray crystal structure N -acetylgalacto-samine-4-sulfatase arylsulfatase A, using homology modeling, 32 missense mutations investigated. Consequently, propose least three different reasons severe phenotype (i) destruction hydrophobic core modification packing; (ii) removal salt bridge destabilize entire conformation; (iii) modification active site. In contrast, mild mutations mostly located surface GALNS protein. These studies shed light genotype-phenotype correlation MPS IVA structure-function relationship sulfatase family. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome: cellular impairments implication carrier detection. A family two male siblings affected Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) studied using G-6-PD isoenzymes X-linked marker order investigate nature cellular abnormalities. Isolated peripheral blood cell types doubly heterozygous mother affected males seemingly failed express G-6-PD allele cis position WAS allele cultured skin fibroblasts expressed G-6-PD alleles. Additionally, histogram analysis platelet size revealed single population abnormally small platelets affected propositus, whereas heterozygous mother appreciable small platelet subpopulation. In vitro culture hemopoietic progenitor cells heterozygous mother showed majority progenitor cells express WAS allele. However, small number cells expressing G-6-PD type linked WAS allele detected. The proportion latter progenitors significantly higher among primitive progenitors (those giving rise later appearing colonies). This observation suggests selection cells expressing Wiskott-Aldrich defect takes place hemopoietic system heterozygous female offers possible means carrier detection women. Linkage studies family revealed one example probable recombination loci WAS G-6-PD among three informative subjects, suggesting two loci may closely linked X-chromosome.. Familial deficiency seventh component complement associated recurrent meningococcal infections.

Each base change confirmed allele-specific amplification patients genomic DNA. It interesting note mutation found HPRTPerth identical reported HPRTFlint. It appears two mutations de novo events.. Sjogren-Larsson syndrome. Impaired fatty alcohol oxidation cultured fibroblasts due deficient fatty alcohol:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide oxidoreductase activity. Lipid metabolism studied cultured skin fibroblasts patients inherited disorder, Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS). Intact SLS fibroblasts incubated presence [1-14C] palmitate accumulated radioactive hexadecanol normal cells, whereas incorporation radioactivity cellular lipids unaltered. The hexadecanol content SLS fibroblasts abnormally elevated. Hexadecanol accumulation due increased fatty alcohol synthesis deficient utilization glycerol ether synthesis. The half-life intracellular hexadecanol loaded SLS fibroblasts increased (70 min) compared normal (15 min), intact SLS fibroblasts showed impaired oxidation [14C] -hexadecanol fatty acid. Fatty alcohol NAD + oxidoreductase, enzyme catalyzing reaction, deficient SLS fibroblasts. Mean total activity SLS fibroblasts (n = 5) 13% normal fibroblasts, palmitoyl CoA-inhibitable activity 1% normal. Fibroblasts two obligate SLS heterozygotes enzyme activities intermediate normal fibroblasts individuals SLS. These results suggest primary defect SLS deficiency fatty alcohol NAD + oxidoreductase. SLS represents first inherited disorder man associated isolated abnormality fatty alcohol metabolism.. Glycerol correlate impaired glucose tolerance: dissection complex system use simple genetic trait. Glycerol kinase (GK) represents primary entry glycerol glucose triglyceride metabolism. Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) hypertriglyceridemia associated increased risk diabetes mellitus cardiovascular disease. The relationship glycerol risk IGT, however, poorly understood. We therefore undertook study fasting plasma glycerol levels cohort 1, 056 unrelated men women French-Canadian descent. Family screening initial cohort identified 18 men five families severe hyperglycerolemia (values 2. 0 mmol/liter) demonstrated X-linked pattern inheritance. Linkage analysis data 12 microsatellite markers surrounding Xp21. 3 GK gene resulted peak LOD score 3. 46, centered around marker DXS8039. In addition, since families originated population proven founder effect-the Saguenay Lac-St. -Jean region Quebec-a common disease haplotype sought. Indeed, six-marker haplotype extending region 5. 5 cM observed families. Resequencing GK gene family members led discovery N288D missense mutation exon 10, resulted substitution highly conserved asparagine residue negatively charged aspartic acid. Assignment aspartylglucosaminidase gene (AGA) 4q33----q35 based decreased activity girl 46,XX,del(4)(q33) karyotype. Aspartylglucosaminuria (AGU) recessive autosomally inherited lysosomal storage disorder due deficiency enzyme aspartylglucosaminidase (AGA). The structural gene human enzyme (AGA) assigned region 4q21----qter. We determined AGA activity cultured fibroblasts girl 46, XX, del (4) (q33) karyotype. The results indicate girl hemizygote AGA, permitting assignment human AGA region 4q33----qter.. Mutations fibrinogen aalpha gene account majority cases congenital afibrinogenemia. Congenital afibrinogenemia rare, autosomal, recessive disorder characterized complete absence detectable fibrinogen. We previously identified first causative mutations nonconsanguineous Swiss family; 4 affected persons homozygous deletions approximately 11 kb fibrinogen alpha (FGA) gene. Haplotype data implied deletions occurred distinct ancestral chromosomes, suggesting region may susceptible deletion common mechanism. We subsequently showed deletions identical base pair probably resulted nonhomologous recombination mediated 7-bp direct repeats. In study, collected data 13 additional unrelated patients identify causative mutations determine prevalence 11-kb deletion. A common recurrent mutation, donor splice site FGA intron 4 (IVS4 + 1 G > T), accounted 14 26 (54%) alleles. One patient heterozygous previously identified deletion. Three frameshift mutations, 2 nonsense mutations, second splice site mutation also identified. Consequently, 86% afibrinogenemia alleles analyzed date truncating mutations FGA, though mutations 3 fibrinogen genes, FGG, FGA, FGB, might predicted cause congenital afibrinogenemia.. Utilization purines HPRT variant intelligent, nonmutilative patient features Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The patient, H. Chr. B., among first reported hyperuricemia central nervous system symptoms. He found variant hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT; E. C. 2. 4. 2. 8) distinct enzyme present patients Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. The patient chroeoathetosis, spasticity, dysarthric speech, hyperuricemia. However, intelligence normal evidence self-mutilation. There activity HPRT lysates erythrocytes cultured fibroblasts analyzed usual manner. Using newly developed method study purine metabolism intact cultured cells, patient found metabolize 9% 8-14C-hypoxanthine, 90% isotope utilized converted adenine guanine nucleotides. In contrast, cells patients Lesch-Nyhan syndrome virtually completely unable convert hypoxanthine nucleotides. The patients fibroblasts even efficient metabolism 8-14C-guanine, utilized extent 27%, 80% converted guanine adenine nucleotides. The growth cultured fibroblasts patient intermediate media containing hypoxanthine aminopterin thymidine (HAT), whereas growth Lesch-Nyhan cells inhibited normal cells grew normally. Similarly 8-azaguanine, 6-thioguanine, 8-azahypoxanthine, growth patients cells intermediate normal Lesch-Nyhan cells. These observations provide evidence genetic heterogeneity among patients disorders purine metabolism involving HPRT gene. They document famous patient Lesch-Nyhan syndrome Canavan disease: mutations among Jewish non-Jewish patients. Canavan disease autosomal recessive leukodystrophy caused deficiency aspartoacylase (ASPA). Sixty-four probands analyzed mutations ASPA gene. Three point mutations--693C-- > A, 854A-- > C, 914C-- > A--were identified coding sequence. The 693C-- > A 914C-- > A base changes, resulting nonsense tyr231-- > ter missense ala305-- > glu mutations, respectively, lead complete loss ASPA activity vitro expression studies. The 854A-- > C transversion converted glu ala codon 285. The glu285-- > ala mutant ASPA 2. 5% activity expressed wild-type enzyme. A fourth mutation, 433 --2 (A-- > G) transition, identified splice-acceptor site intron 2. The splice-site mutation would lead skipping exon 3, accompanied frameshift, thus would produce aberrant ASPA. Of 128 unrelated Canavan chromosomes analyzed, 88 probands Ashkenazi Jewish descent. The glu285-- > ala mutation predominant (82. 9%) population, followed tyr231-- > ter (14. 8%) 433 --2 (A-- > G) (1. 1%) mutations. The three mutations account 98. 8% Canavan chromosomes Ashkenazi Jewish origin. The ala305-- > glu mutation found exclusively non-Jewish probands European descent constituted 60% 40 mutant chromosomes. Predominant occurrence certain mutations among Ashkenazi Jewish non-Jewish patients Canavan disease would suggest founding-father effect propagation mutant chromosomes Identification deletion mutations three new genes familial polyposis locus. Small (100-260 kb), nested deletions characterized DNA two unrelated patients familial adenomatous polyposis coli (APC). Three candidate genes located within deleted region ascertained previous candidate gene, MCC, shown located outside deleted region. One new genes contained sequence identical SRP19, gene coding 19 kd component ribosomal signal recognition particle. The second, provisionally designated DP1 (deleted polyposis 1), found transcribed orientation MCC. Two cDNAs, DP2 DP3, found overlap, forming single gene, DP2. 5, transcribed orientation SRP19.

These results provide regionalized map position major human disease locus also serve reference point linkage analysis DNA markers human chromosome 12 Total deficiency plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein subjects homozygous heterozygous intron 14 splicing defect. The molecular basis cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) deficiency investigated 4 unrelated CETP-deficient families. The high density lipoprotein-cholesterol levels probands exceeded 150 mg/dl. The plasma probands totally deficient CETP activity mass. The genomic DNA patients amplified polymerase chain reaction, using two oligonucleotide primers located intron 12 14 CETP gene, amplified products directly sequenced. Two patients homozygous G-to-A change 5-splice donor site intron 14. The G-to-A change would cause impaired splicing pre-messenger RNA. The two probands heterozygous mutation, totally lacked CETP. Their lipoprotein patterns also similar two homozygotes. Thus, genetic defects metabolic factors influencing CETP expression implicated. The data suggest G-to-A mutation may common human plasma CETP deficiency. Furthermore, could compound heterozygotes totally lack plasma CETP lipoprotein profiles similar homozygotes.. Heterogeneity type I von Willebrand disease: evidence subgroup abnormal von Willebrand factor. Type I von Willebrand disease (vWD) characterized equally low plasma concentrations von Willebrand factor antigen (vWF Ag) ristocetin cofactor (RiCof) presence vWF multimers sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -agarose gel electrophoresis. For 17 patients (13 kindreds) diagnosed criteria, studied platelet contents vWF Ag RiCof changes plasma DDAVP infusion. Platelet vWF Ag RiCof normal four kindreds (called " platelet normal " subgroup); following 1-deamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin; plasma vWF Ag, RiCof bleeding time (BT) became normal. In six kindreds, platelet vWF Ag RiCof equally low (platelet low); DDAVP, plasma vWF Ag RiCof remained low, BT prolonged. In three additional kindreds, platelets contained normal concentrations vWF Ag, RiCof low (platelet discordant); even though complete set multimers found plasma platelets, relatively small amount large multimers. After DDAVP, plasma vWF Ag became normal, RiCof remained low BT prolonged. These findings demonstrated abnormal vWF (RiCof less vWF Ag) even type I vWD, coexisting complete set vWF multimers (platelet discordant); abnormal vWF shown clearly platelets plasma else plasma DDAVP infusion; DDAVP normalizes BT patients normal platelet levels vWF Ag RiCof (platelet normal).. Characterization YAC containing part Norrie disease locus. It shown pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) monoamine oxidase genes A B (MAOA & MAOB) DXS7 loci physically close.

The gene structure FHF2 determined two new exons identified, including new 5 end exon, 1B. FHF2 large gene extending approximately 200 kb Xq26. 3 composed least seven exons. It shows tissue-specific alternative splicing alternative transcription starts. Northern blot hybridisation showed highest expression brain skeletal muscle. The FHF2 gene localisation tissue-specific expression pattern suggest candidate gene familial cases BFLS syndrome syndromal non-specific forms X-linked mental retardation mapping region. Illegitimate transcription phenylalanine hydroxylase gene lymphocytes identification mutations phenylketonuria. Taking advantage illegitimate transcription phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene, able analyse PAH cDNA sequence hyperphenylalaninemic children circulating lymphocytes. Using approach, also identified 3 novel mutations cDNA liver lymphocytes two patients. One mutation, detected abnormal pattern migration amplified fragment, C T transition splice acceptor site intron 10, resulted skipping exon 11 premature termination RNA translation downstream exon 12 (-3 IVS10). The two mutations missense mutations exons 10 11 (respectively, L333F E390G). The present study supports view circulating lymphocytes give easy access PAH gene transcripts whose nucleotide sequence identical reported liver therefore represent useful tool molecular genetic studies phenylketonuria.. Function axonal chemoattractant modulated metalloprotease activity. The axonal chemoattractant netrin-1 guides spinal commissural axons activating receptor DCC (Deleted Colorectal Cancer ). We found chemical inhibitors metalloproteases potentiate netrin-mediated axon outgrowth vitro. We also found DCC substrate metalloprotease-dependent ectodomain shedding, inhibitors block proteolytic processing DCC cause increase DCC protein levels axons within spinal cord explants. Thus, potentiation netrin activity inhibitors may result stabilization DCC axons, proteolytic activity may regulate axon migration controlling number functional extracellular axon guidance receptors.. Choroideremia: close linkage DXYS1 DXYS12 demonstrated segregation analysis historical-genealogical evidence. Linkage studies using restriction fragment length polymorphisms conducted X-linked disorder, choroideremia, designated TCD Progressive Tapeto-Choroidal Dystrophy. Previously demonstrated close linkage locus DXYS1 confirmed (lod 11. 44 0 recombination distance). In addition, locus DXYS12 found closely linked TCD (lod 3. 31 0 recombination distance). The disease mainly occurs three large kindreds remote Northern Finland. While formal genealogical proof lacking, presently living (more 80 affected males 120 carrier females) probably originate common founder couple born 1644 1646, twelve generations ago. All 36 patients 48 carriers tested three kindreds haplotype (TCD/DXYS1, 11kb/DXYS12, 1. 6kb). Given least 105 female meioses transmitting TCD occurred since 1650 kindreds, extremely close linkage TCD, DXYS1 DXYS12 suggested. The haplotype useful diagnostic tool TCD families. We suggest historical-genealogical approach linkage analysis may possible elsewhere similar isolated populations Functional consequences mutations early growth response 2 gene (EGR2) correlate severity human myelinopathies. The early growth response 2 gene (EGR2) Cys2His2zinc finger transcription factor thought play role regulation peripheral nervous system myelination. This idea based partly phenotype homozygous Krox20 (Egr2) knockout mice, display hypomyelination PNS block Schwann cells early stage differentiation. Mutations human EGR2 gene recently associated inherited peripheral neuropathies Charcot-Marie-Tooth type 1, Dejerine-Sottas syndrome congenital hypomyelinating neuropathy. Three four EGR2 mutations dominant occur within zinc finger DNA-binding domain. The fourth mutation recessive affects inhibitory domain (R1) binds NAB transcriptional co-repressors. A combination DNA-binding assays transcriptional analysis used determine functional consequences mutations. The zinc finger mutations affect DNA binding amount residual binding directly correlates disease severity. The R1 domain mutation prevents interaction EGR2 NAB co-repressors thereby increases transcriptional activity. These data provide insight possible disease mechanisms underlying EGR2 mutations reason varying severity differences inheritance patterns.. Molecular basis human von Willebrand disease: analysis platelet von Willebrand factor mRNA. von Willebrand disease (vWD), common inherited bleeding disorder humans, result either quantitative qualitative defect adhesive glycoprotein, von Willebrand factor (vWF). Molecular studies vWD limited large size vWF gene difficulty obtaining vWF mRNA patients. By use adaptation polymerase chain reaction, vWF mRNA amplified sequenced peripheral blood platelets. A silent vWF allele identified, resulting cis defect vWF mRNA transcription processing. In two type IIA vWD patients, two different adjacent missense mutations identified, locations may identify important vWF functional domain. Expression heterologous cells recombinant vWF containing one latter mutations reproduced characteristic structural abnormality seen type IIA vWD plasma.. A transgene insertion creating heritable chromosome deletion mouse model Prader-Willi angelman syndromes. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) Angelman syndrome (AS) result loss function imprinted genes human chromosome 15q11-q13. The central part mouse chromosome 7 homologous human 15q11-q13, conservation gene order imprinted features. We report characterization transgene insertion (Epstein-Barr virus Latent Membrane Protein 2A, LMP2A) mouse chromosome 7C, resulted mouse models PWS AS dependent sex transmitting parent. Epigenotype (allelic expression DNA methylation) fluorescence situ hybridization analyses indicate transgene-induced mutation generated complete deletion PWS/AS-homologous region deleted flanking loci. Because intact chromosome 7, opposite deleted homolog, maintains correct imprint somatic cells PWS AS mice establishes correct imprint male female germ cells AS mice, homologous association replication asynchrony part imprinting mechanism. This heritable-deletion mouse model particularly useful identification etiological genes mechanisms, phenotypic basis, investigation therapeutic approaches PWS.. Transgenic mice expressing truncated form high mobility group I-C protein develop adiposity abnormally high prevalence lipomas. Chromosomal translocations human lipomas frequently create fusion transcripts encoding high mobility group (HMG) I-C DNA-binding domains C-terminal sequences different presumed transcription factors, suggesting potential role HMG I-C development lipomas. To evaluate role HMG I-C component, three DNA-binding domains HMG I-C expressed transgenic mice. Despite ubiquitous expression truncated HMG I-C protein, transgenic mice develop selective abundance fat tissue early life, show marked adipose tissue inflammation, abnormally high incidence lipomas. These findings demonstrate DNA-binding domains HMG I-C, absence C-terminal fusion partner, sufficient perturb adipogenesis predispose lipomas. We provide data supporting central utility animal model tool understand molecular mechanisms underlying development one common kind human benign tumors.. A common MSH2 mutation English North American HNPCC families: origin, phenotypic expression, sex specific differences colorectal cancer. The frequency, origin, phenotypic expression germline MSH2 gene mutation previously identified seven kindreds hereditary non-polyposis cancer syndrome (HNPCC) investigated. The mutation (A-- > T nt943 + 3) disrupts 3 splice site exon 5 leading deletion exon MSH2 mRNA represents frequent MSH2 mutation far reported. Although mutation initially detected four 33 colorectal cancer families analysed eastern England, extensive analysis reduced frequency four 52 (8%) English HNPCC kindreds analysed. In contrast, MSH2 mutation identified 10 20 (50%) separately identified colorectal families Newfoundland. To investigate origin mutation colorectal cancer families England (n = 4), Newfoundland (n = 10), United States (n = 3), haplotype analysis using microsatellite markers linked MSH2 performed. Within English US families little evidence recent common origin MSH2 splice site mutation families. In contrast, common haplotype identified two flanking markers (CA5 D2S288) eight Newfoundland families. These findings suggested founder effect within Newfoundland similar reported others two MLH1 mutations Finnish HNPCC families. We calculated age related risks all, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian cancers nt943 + 3 A-- > T MSH2 mutation carriers (n = 76) patients men women separately. For sexes combined, penetrances age 60 years cancers colorectal cancer 0. 86 0. 57, respectively. The risk colorectal cancer significantly higher (p < 0. 01) males females (0. 63 v 0. 30 0. 84 v 0. 44 ages 50 60 years, respectively). For females high risk endometrial cancer (0. 5 age 60 years) premenopausal ovarian cancer (0. 2 50 years). These intersex differences colorectal cancer risks implications screening programmes attempts identify colorectal cancer susceptibility modifiers. Novel mutation initiation codon Norrie disease gene two Japanese families. We identified new mutation Norrie disease (ND) gene two Japanese males unrelated families; showed typical ocular features ND mental retardation hearing impairment. A mutation found patients initiation codon exon 2 ND gene (ATG GTG), otherwise normal nucleotide sequences. Their mothers normal mutant types gene, expected heterozygotes disease. The mutation initiation codon would cause failure ND gene expression defect translation thereby truncating amino terminus ND protein. In view rarity marked heterogeneity mutations ND gene, present apparently unrelated Japanese families lived area two centuries presumably share origin mutation.. Haplotype phenotype analysis six recurrent BRCA1 mutations 61 families: results international study. Several BRCA1 mutations found occur geographically diverse breast ovarian cancer families. To investigate mutation origin mutation-specific phenotypes due BRCA1, constructed haplotype nine polymorphic markers within immediately flanking BRCA1 locus set 61 breast/ovarian cancer families selected one six recurrent BRCA1 mutations. Tests mutations family-specific differences age diagnosis significant. A comparison six mutations relative proportions cases breast ovarian cancer suggestive effect (P =. 069), 57% women presumed affected 1294 del 40 BRCA1 mutation ovarian cancer, compared 14% affected women splice-site mutation intron 5 BRCA1. For BRCA1 mutations studied here, individual mutations estimated arisen 9-170 generations ago. In general, high degree haplotype conservation across region observed, haplotype differences often due mutations short-tandem-repeat markers, although likely instances recombination also observed. For several instances, evidence multiple, independent, BRCA1 mutational events. A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase variant (G6PD Nagano) associated congenital hemolytic anemia. A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variant associated chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia reported. The patient, 6-year-old Japanese male, noticed hemolytic anemia soon birth, diagnosis G6PD deficiency made age 2. He episodes hemolytic crisis several times upper respiratory infection. G6PD activity patient 5. 5% normal. The enzymatic characteristics examined 5 years old, G6PD showed faster-than-normal electrophoretic mobility, low Km G6P, high Km NADP, low Ki NADPH, normal utilization substrate analogues, heat instability, normal pH optimum curve. From results, considered new variant designated G6PD Nagano. Infection-induced hemolysis chronic hemolytic anemia seem due markedly impaired enzyme activity thermal instability. Craniofrontonasal dysplasia. We report nine patients craniofrontonasal dysplasia (CFND). Seven classical cases facial features suggestive frontonasal dysplasia coronal craniosynostosis. Extracranial abnormalities brittle nails prominent longitudinal grooves syndactyly fingers toes observed individual patients. In two families father classical cases showed milder pattern abnormalities, consistent diagnosis. We present 2- 13-year follow-up patients. Hypotonia laxity joints common may necessitate supportive measures. Mild developmental delay noted three six classical cases studied detail. Unlike almost X-linked disorders, clinical expression CFND generally much severe females males. In contrast previous reports condition, one severely affected cases male.. A new mutation proteolipid protein (PLP) gene German family Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease.

The mutation, causes loss HphI site changes amino acid 155 threonine isoleucine, absent 108 normal chromosomes. There 5 concordances 1 discrepancy results obtained magnetic resonance imaging family.. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome X-linked congenital thrombocytopenia caused mutations gene. The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) X-linked recessive disorder characterized thrombocytopenia, small platelets, eczema, recurrent infections, immunodeficiency. Besides classic WAS phenotype, group patients congenital X-linked thrombocytopenia (XLT) small platelets transient eczema, any, minimal immune deficiency. Because gene responsible WAS sequenced, possible correlate WAS phenotypes WAS gene mutations. Using fingerprinting screening technique, determined approximate location mutation 13 unrelated WAS patients mild severe clinical symptoms. Direct sequence analysis cDNA genomic DNA obtained patient-derived cell lines showed 12 unique mutations distributed throughout WAS gene, including insertions, deletions, point mutations resulting amino acid substitutions, termination, exon skipping, splicing defects. Of 4 unrelated patients XLT phenotype, 3 missense mutations affecting exon 2 1 splice-site mutation affecting exon 9. Patients classic WAS complex mutations, resulting termination codons, frameshift, early termination. These findings provide direct evidence XLT WAS caused mutations gene suggest severe clinical phenotypes associated complex mutations.. A 3-base pair in-frame deletion phenylalanine hydroxylase gene results kinetic variant phenylketonuria. Phenylketonuria (PKU) autosomal recessive disease due deficiency hepatic enzyme, phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH). The absence PAH activity results typical PKU persistence residual enzyme activity gives rise variant forms disease. We report 3-base pair in-frame deletion PAH gene (delta 194) mild variant, markedly reduced affinity enzyme phenylalanine (Km = 160 nM), provide functional evidence responsibility deletion mutant phenotype. Since deletion located third exon gene, presents homology hydroxylases, suggest exon 3 involved specificity enzyme phenylalanine. Finally, since none 98 PKU patients tested found carry particular deletion, study suggests molecular event probably occurred recently background haplotype 2 gene Portugal.. Friedreich ataxia: overview. Friedreich ataxia, autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disease, common inherited ataxias. The recent discovery gene mutated condition, FRDA, led rapid advances understanding pathogenesis Friedreich ataxia. About 98% mutant alleles expansion GAA trinucleotide repeat intron 1 gene. This leads reduced levels protein, frataxin.

Prostatic tissue specimens derived transurethral resections patients metastatic prostate cancer analyzed genetic alterations hormone-binding domain androgen receptor (AR) gene. Direct sequencing polymerase chain reaction-derived DNAs 6 24 specimens revealed codon 877 mutation (ACT-- > GCT, Thr-- > Ala) hormone-binding domain AR gene. This AR mutation reported previously metastatic prostate cancer cell line, LNCaP, mutation confers upon AR altered ligand-binding specificity stimulated estrogens, progestagens, antiandrogens. It possible analogous activated/altered growth factor receptor oncogene, codon 877 mutant AR altered ligand binding may provide selective growth advantage genesis subset advanced prostate cancer. Although estrogens used infrequently, antiandrogens used increasingly hormonal therapy patients advanced prostate cancer. The stimulatory effect therapeutic agents codon 877 mutant AR suggests frequently observed AR mutation may contribute treatment refractory disease.. ATM-dependent phosphorylation nibrin response radiation exposure. Mutations gene ATM responsible genetic disorder ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T), characterized cerebellar dysfunction, radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability cancer predisposition. Both A-T phenotype similarity ATM protein DNA-damage sensors suggests role ATM biochemical pathways involved recognition, signalling repair DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs). There strong parallels pattern radiosensitivity, chromosomal instability cancer predisposition A-T patients patients Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS). The protein defective NBS, nibrin (encoded NBS1), forms complex MRE11 RAD50 (refs 1, 2). This complex localizes DSBs within 30 minutes cellular exposure ionizing radiation (IR) observed brightly staining nuclear foci longer period time. The overlap clinical cellular phenotypes A-T NBS suggests ATM nibrin may function biochemical pathway. Here demonstrate nibrin phosphorylated within one hour treatment cells IR. This response abrogated A-T cells either express ATM protein express near full-length mutant protein. We also show ATM physically interacts phosphorylates nibrin serine 343 vivo vitro. Phosphorylation site appears functionally important mutated nibrin (S343A) completely complement radiosensitivity NBS cells. ATM phosphorylation nibrin affect nibrin-MRE11-RAD50 association revealed radiation-induced foci formation. Our data provide biochemical explanation similarity phenotype A-T NBS.. Detection unstable fragment DNA specific individuals myotonic dystrophy. Myotonic dystrophy (DM) common form adult muscular dystrophy, prevalence 2-14 per 100, 000 individuals. The disease characterized progressive muscle weakness sustained muscle contraction, often wide range accompanying symptoms. The age onset severity disease show extreme variation, within families. Despite clinical variability, dominant condition segregates single locus chromosome 19q13. 3 every population studied. It flanked tightly linked genetic markers ERCC1 proximally D19S51 distally; define DM critical region. We report isolation expressed sequence region detects DNA fragment larger affected individuals normal siblings unaffected controls. The size fragment varies affected siblings, increases size generations parallel increasing severity disease. We postulate unstable DNA sequence molecular feature underlies DM. Detection novel missense mutation second recurrent mutation CACNA1A gene individuals EA-2 FHM. Mutations brain specific P/Q type Ca2 + channel alpha1 subunit gene, CACNA1A, identified three clinically distinct disorders, viz. episodic ataxia type 2 (EA-2), familial hemiplegic migraine (FHM) spinocerebellar ataxia 6 (SCA6). For individuals EA-2, mutations described thus far presumed result truncated protein product. Several different missense mutations identified patients FHM. At least two mutations identified two different chromosome 19p13 haplotypes thus represent recurrent mutations. In present study, screened several individuals mutations 47 exons CACNA1A gene single-strand conformation analysis. We characterised novel missense mutation, G5260A, exon 32 family segregating EA-2. The consequence mutation amino acid substitution highly conserved position within CACNA1A gene. This represents first point mutation resulting proposed truncated protein. Furthermore, mutation detected family member mild clinical signs including migraine. Additionally, second previously identified recurrent muta tion, C2272T, exon 16 discovered patient FHM.. Dominant negative effect APC1309 mutation: possible explanation genotype-phenotype correlations familial adenomatous polyposis. Inactivation adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene product initiates colorectal tumorigenesis. Patients familial APC (FAP) carry germ-line mutations APC gene develop multiple colorectal adenomas subsequent carcinomas early life. The severity disease correlates position inherited APC mutation (genotype-phenotype correlation). Together fact germ-line sporadic APC mutations cluster central region APC gene, points dominant negative effect certain APC mutants. Loss APC function recently shown result enhanced beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription colon epithelial cells. Here, provide experimental evidence dominant negative effect APC gene products associated severe polyposis. Wild-type APC activity beta-catenin-/Tcf-mediated transcription strongly inhibited mutant APC truncated codon 1309. In contrast, mutant APC gene products associated attenuated polyposis (codon 386 1465) interfered weakly wild-type APC activity. These results suggest molecular explanation genotype-phenotype correlation FAP patients support idea colorectal tumor growth might be, part, driven selection mutation mutation cluster region.. Mutation KIT (mast/stem cell growth factor receptor) protooncogene human piebaldism. Piebaldism autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized cogenital patches skin hair melanocytes completely absent. A similar disorder mouse, dominant white spotting (W), results mutations c-Kit protooncogene, encodes receptor mast/stem cell growth factor. We identified KIT gene mutation proband classic autosomal dominant piebaldism. This mutation results Gly----Arg substitution codon 664, within tyrosine kinase domain. This substitution seen normal individuals completely linked piebald phenotype probands family. Piebaldism family thus appears human homologue dominant white spotting (W) mouse.. An arylsulfatase A (ARSA) missense mutation (T274M) causing late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy. Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused deficiency arylsulfatase A (ARSA; EC 3. 1. 6. 8). The 8 ARSA exons adjacent intron boundaries patient late-infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplified seven discrete reactions. Amplified ARSA exons analysed presence sequence alterations single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, followed direct sequencing PCR products. The patient found homozygous C-- > T transition exon IV results substitution highly conserved threonine residue amino acid 274 methionine (T274M). Analysis 29 MLD patients revealed presence five additional homozygotes T274M. All 6 T274M homozygotes (representing four families) Lebanese descent, known result consanguineous marriages. The altered amino acid rigidly conserved among 10 sulfatases Escherichia coli humans; therefore, likely resultant mutant protein little enzyme activity. This consistent low ARSA activity measured patients uniformly severe clinical presentation Mutations gene X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy patients different clinical phenotypes. Recently, gene common peroxisomal disorder, X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD), described encoding peroxisomal membrane transporter protein. We analyzed entire protein-coding sequence gene reverse-transcription PCR, SSCP, DNA sequencing five patients different clinical expression X-ALD female relatives; clinical expressions cerebral childhood ALD, adrenomyeloneuropathy (AMN), " Addison disease " (ADO) phenotype. In three patients exhibiting classical picture severe childhood ALD identified 5 portion X-ALD gene 38-bp deletion causes frameshift mutation, 3-bp deletion leading deletion amino acid ATP-binding domain ALD protein, missense mutation. In patient clinical phenotype AMN, nonsense mutation codon 212, along second site mutation codon 178, observed. Analysis patient ADO phenotype revealed missense mutation highly conserved position ALDP/PMP70 comparison. The disruptive nature two mutations (i. e., frameshift nonsense mutation) patients biochemically proved childhood ALD AMN strongly supports hypothesis alterations gene play crucial role pathogenesis X-ALD. Since current biochemical techniques X-ALD carrier detection affected families lack sufficient reliability, procedure described systematic mutation scanning also capable improving genetic counseling prenatal diagnosis Atelosteogenesis type II caused mutations diastrophic dysplasia sulfate-transporter gene (DTDST): evidence phenotypic series involving three chondrodysplasias. Atelosteogenesis type II (AO II) neonatally lethal chondrodysplasia whose clinical histological characteristics resemble another chondrodysplasia, much less severe diastrophic dysplasia (DTD). The similarity suggests shared pathogenesis involving lesions biochemical pathway perhaps gene. DTD caused mutations recently identified diastrophic dysplasia sulfate-transporter gene (DTDST). Here, report AOII patients also DTDST mutations, lead defective uptake inorganic sulfate insufficient sulfation macromolecules patient mesenchymal cells vitro. Together recent observation third even severe chondrodysplasia, achondrogenesis type IB, also caused mutations DTDST, results demonstrate phenotypic series three chondrodysplasias increasing severity caused lesions single sulfate-transporter gene. The severity phenotype appears correlated predicted effect mutations residual activity DTDST protein.. Emerin, deficiency causes Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy, localized inner nuclear membrane. X-linked recessive Emery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy (EDMD) inherited muscle disorder characterized clinical triad progressive wasting humero-peroneal muscles, early contractures elbows, Achilles tendons postcervical muscles, cardiac conduction block high risk sudden death. The gene EDMD Xq28 encodes novel protein named emerin localizes nuclear membrane skeletal, cardiac smooth muscles non-muscle tissues. To investigate possible physiological role emerin, examined ultrastructural localization protein human skeletal muscle HeLa cells, using ultrathin cryosections. We found immune-labeled colloidal gold particles localized nucleoplasmic surface inner nuclear membrane, nuclear pore. Emerin stayed cytoplasmic surface nuclear lamina, even detergent treatment solubilizes membrane lipids washes membrane proteins. These results suggest emerin anchors inner nuclear membrane hydrophobic stretch, protrudes hydrophilic region nucleoplasm interacts nuclear lamina. We speculate emerin contributes maintain nuclear structure stability, well nuclear functions, particularly muscle tissues severe stress rigorous contraction-relaxation movements calcium flux.. Identification common PEX1 mutation Zellweger syndrome. The Zellweger spectrum disease, encompassing Zellweger syndrome progressively milder phenotypes neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy infantile Refsum disease, due failure form functional peroxisomes. Cell fusion complementation studies demonstrated diseases genetically heterogeneous, two-thirds patients lying within single complementation group, CG1. Molecular genetic cell biology studies shown PEX1 deficient many CG1 patients. However, previous studies focused mildly affected patients still report two mutant PEX1 alleles Zellweger syndrome patient. Furthermore, mutations PMP70 gene also identified two Zellweger syndrome patients CG1, raising possibility CG1 patients may represent mixture PEX1-deficient PMP70-deficient individuals. To address molecular basis disease Zellweger syndrome patients CG1, examined 24 PEX1 exons four patients, including patients mutations PMP70. PEX1 mutations detected four patients, including 1-bp insertion (c. 2097insT) exon 13 present three four patients. Subsequent studies demonstrated mutation present one-half CG1 patients correlates Zellweger syndrome phenotype. As mutation leads loss protein function frequency makes common cause Zellweger syndrome, helping explain high percentage patients belong CG1. Polymorphisms CYP2D6 gene increase susceptibility ankylosing spondylitis. Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) common highly familial rheumatic disorder. The sibling recurrence risk ratio disease 63 heritability assessed twins > 90%. Although MHC genes, including HLA-B27, contribute 20-50% genetic risk disease, non-MHC gene yet convincingly demonstrated influence either susceptibility disease phenotypic expression. Previous linkage association studies suggested presence susceptibility gene AS close to, within, cytochrome P450 2D6 gene (CYP2D6, debrisoquine hydroxylase) located chromosome 22q13.1. We performed linkage study chromosome 22 200 families AS affected sibling-pairs. Association alleles CYP2D6 gene examined case-control within-family means. For case-control studies, 617 unrelated individuals AS (361 probands sibling-pair parent-case trio families 256 unrelated non-familial sporadic cases) 402 healthy ethnically matched controls employed. For within-family association studies, 361 families including 161 parent-case trios 200 affected sibling-pair families employed. Homozygosity poor metabolizer alleles found associated AS. Heterozygosity frequent poor metabolizer allele (CYP2D6*4) associated increased susceptibility AS. Significant within-family association CYP2D6*4 alleles AS demonstrated. Weak linkage also demonstrated CYP2D6 AS. We postulate altered metabolism natural toxin antigen CYP2D6 gene may increase susceptibility AS. Molecular analysis genotype-phenotype relationship factor X deficiency. Factor X deficiency rare haemorrhagic condition, normally inherited autosomal recessive trait, variable clinical presentation correlates poorly laboratory phenotype. The factor X (F10) genes 14 unrelated individuals factor X deficiency (12 familial two sporadic cases) sequenced yielding total 13 novel mutations. Family studies performed order distinguish contributions individual mutant F10 alleles clinical laboratory phenotypes. Missense mutations studied means molecular modelling, whereas single basepair substitutions splice sites 5 flanking region examined vitro splicing assay luciferase reporter gene assay respectively. The deletion allele novel hexanucleotide insertion/deletion polymorphism F10 gene promoter region shown reporter gene assay, reduce promoter activity approximately 20%. One family manifesting autosomal dominant pattern inheritance possessed three clinically affected members heterozygous splice-site mutation predicted lead production truncated protein product. A model accounts dominant negative effect lesion presented. Variation antigen level heterozygous relatives probands found significantly higher families within families, consistent view nature F10 lesion (s) segregating given family prime determinant laboratory phenotype. By contrast, relationship could discerned laboratory phenotype polymorphism genotype.. Restoration photoreceptor ultrastructure function retinal degeneration slow mice gene therapy. The gene Prph2 encodes photoreceptor-specific membrane glycoprotein, peripherin-2 (also known peripherin/rds), inserted rims photoreceptor outer segment discs complex rom-1 (ref. 2).

Complex glycerol kinase deficiency: molecular-genetic, cytogenetic, clinical studies five Japanese patients. Five male Japanese patients complex glycerol kinase deficiency (CGKD) relatives studied clinically, cytogenetically, molecular-genetically. All patients muscular dystrophy muscle weakness, mental retardation, congenital adrenal hypoplasia, glycerol kinase deficiency. High-resolution GTG-banded chromosomes showed microdeletion Xp21 region four patients examined five mothers. Southern hybridizations, digestions restriction endonucleases, various cloned DNAs (D2, 99-6, B24, C7, L1-4, cDMD13-14, J66-HI, P20, J-Bir, ERT87-30, ERT87-15, ERT87-8, ERT87-1, XJ-1. 1, 754, cx5. 7, OTC-1) located around Xp21 also showed deletion genome patients mothers. Although deletion differed size among patients, segment commonly absent located genomic sequences corresponding L1-4 cDMD13-14. This finding indicated gene coding glycerol kinase (GK) located within segment. A comparison clinical manifestations present five patients reported CGKD Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients DNA deletion suggests existence certain gene responsible gonadotropin deficiency (GTD). The result present study results previous studies suggest genes ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC), DMD, GK putative genes responsible congenital adrenal hypoplasia (AHC) GTD arranged telomere centromere pter--GTD--AHC--GK--DMD--OTC--cen Duchenne muscular dystrophy myotonic dystrophy patient. We report first patient identified myotonic dystrophy Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). The family propositus strong history myotonic dystrophy, intrafamilial pathological expansion responsible CTG repeat mildly affected mother (160 repeats; normal 27 repeats) severely affected son (650 repeats), sister (650 repeats). The propositus isolated case Duchenne muscular dystrophy marked dystrophin deficiency muscle biopsy. The patient still ambulatory post age 16. Myotonic dystrophy could interfere extent progression Duchenne dystrophy. However, interpretations possible. Twelve percent dystrophin revertant fibers observed immunohistochemistry could sufficient ameliorate typical DMD clinical severity, patient may present somatic mosaic. The pathophysiological interactions two unlinked disorders discussed clinical histopathological levels.. Autosomal recessive transmission hemophilia A due von Willebrand factor mutation. The differential diagnosis genetic bleeding disorders, hemophilia A von Willebrand disease, occasionally confounded close molecular relationship coagulation factor VIII von Willebrand factor (vWF). This report describes autosomal inheritance hemophilia A phenotype due mutation vWF results defective factor VIII binding. The proband female patient low levels factor VIII activity. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification DNA sequencing employed examine exons encoding putative factor VIII binding domain vWF. The patient found homozygous single point mutation causing Thr-- > Met substitution amino acid position 28 mature vWF subunit. The phenotypic expression mutation determined recessive heterozygous family members clinically unaffected. Recombinant vWF containing observed amino acid substitution expressed COS-1 cells. The mutant vWF processed secreted normally, functionally equivalent wild-type vWF ability bind platelets. However, mutant failed bind factor VIII, demonstrating mutation functionally related observed hemophilia phenotype. The family describe demonstrates recessive inheritance recently recognized class genetic bleeding disorders, call " autosomal hemophilia. " We conclude vWF mutation may recognized cause hemophilia, especially cases inheritance pattern consistent X-linked transmission. Determination 30 X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy mutations, including 15 previously described. X-linked Adrenoleukodystrophy (X-ALD) frequent peroxisomal disease. It mainly involves nervous system white matter, adrenal cortex testes. Several distinct clinical phenotypes known. The principal biochemical abnormality accumulation saturated very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs > C22 0, mainly C26 0), due impaired capacity beta-oxidation peroxisomes. Diagnosis usually based VLCFA levels plasma cultured skin fibroblasts patients carriers. In 0. 1% affected males, however, plasma C26 0 level borderline normal, 15% obligate female carriers normal results. Effective mutation detection families therefore fundamental unambiguously determine genetic status individual risk. Of particular concern female members kindreds segregating X-ALD mutations, normal VLCFA levels guarantee lack carrier status. We describe fast method detection X-ALD mutations. The method based SSCP analysis nested PCR fragments followed sequence-determination reactions. Using methodology found X-ALD mutations 30 kindreds, including 15 previously reported. Mutations BRCA1 gene families early-onset breast ovarian cancer. We analysed 50 probands family history breast and/or ovarian cancer germline mutations coding region BRCA1 candidate gene, using single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis PCR-amplified genomic DNA. A total eight putative disease-causing alterations identified four frameshifts two nonsense mutations. In addition, found two missense mutations, one changes final cysteine BRCA1 zinc finger motif glycine. These data consistent tumour suppressor model, support notion candidate gene fact BRCA1. The heterogeneity mutations, coupled large size gene, indicates clinical application BRCA1 mutation testing technically challenging.. Screening carriers Tay-Sachs disease among Ashkenazi Jews. A comparison DNA-based enzyme-based tests. BACKGROUND AND METHODS. The prevention Tay-Sachs disease (GM2 gangliosidosis, type 1) depends identification carriers gene autosomal recessive disorder. We compared enzyme-based test widely used screening Tay-Sachs disease test based analysis DNA. We developed methods detect three mutations HEXA gene occur high frequency among Ashkenazi Jews two mutations cause infantile Tay-Sachs disease, third causes adult-onset form disease. DNA segments containing mutation sites amplified polymerase chain reaction analyzed presence mutations. RESULTS. Among 62 Ashkenazi obligate carriers Tay-Sachs disease, three specific mutations accounted one mutant alleles (98 percent). In 216 Ashkenazi carriers identified enzyme test, DNA analysis showed 177 (82 percent) one identified mutations. Of 177, 79 percent exon 11 insertion mutation, 18 percent intron 12 splice-junction mutation, 3 percent less severe exon 7 mutation associated adult-onset disease. The results enzyme tests 39 subjects (18 percent) defined carriers DNA analysis identify mutant allele probably false positive (although remains possibility unidentified mutations). In addition, 152 persons defined noncarriers enzyme-based test, 1 identified carrier DNA analysis (i. e e., false negative enzyme-test result). CONCLUSIONS. The increased specificity predictive value DNA-based test make useful adjunct diagnostic tests currently used screen carriers Tay-Sachs disease. Adrenoleukodystrophy gene encodes 80 kDa membrane protein. An antibody synthetic C-terminal peptides deduced cDNA gene responsible X-linked adrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) produced characterize product ALD gene. The antibody reacted 80 kDa band protein control fibroblasts, bands detected fibroblasts patient ALD (# 163), mRNA ALD gene undetectable based Northern blot analysis. The 293T cells transfected full-coding cDNA inserted expression vector produced new 80 kDa protein, detected Western blot. In immunocytological study, staining punctate pattern, normal fibroblasts. However, punctate staining # 163 cells. These data thus indicate ALD gene encodes 80 kDa membrane protein.. Preferential germline mutation paternal allele retinoblastoma. The event triggering malignant proliferation 70% retinoblastoma tumours loss heterozygosity chromosome 13q14, whereby normal retinoblastoma gene (RB1) allele lost already mutated RB1 allele remains tumour. The first allele suffers mutational event--deletion, duplication point mutation (manuscript preparation) --either germ line (all bilateral patients) somatic retinal cell (most unilateral patients). Most bilateral patients family history retinoblastoma presumed new germline mutations arose egg, sperm early embryo. We determined parental origin retained allele nine retinoblastoma tumours eight unrelated non-familial cases using RB1-linked genetic markers. Six tumours retained paternal allele three retained maternal allele. Of three unilateral tumours, one retained paternal RB1 allele. Thus, evidence paternal RB1 allele preferentially retained retinoblastoma, suggested case osteosarcoma. By contrast, tumours four five bilateral patients retained paternal RB1 allele. This suggests either new germline RB1 mutations arise frequently spermatogenesis oogenesis, imprinting early embryo affects chromosomal susceptibility mutation.. Mutations ataxia-telangiectasia locus clinical phenotypes A-T patients. Mutations ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) locus chromosome band 11q22 cause distinctive autosomal recessive syndrome homozygotes predispose heterozygotes cancer, ischemic heart disease, early mortality. PCR amplification genomic DNA automated sequencing entire coding region (66 exons) splice junctions detected 77 mutations (85%) 90 A-T chromosomes. Heteroduplex analysis detected another 42 mutations A-T locus. Out total 71 unique mutations, 50 found single family, 51 reported previously. Most (58/71, 82%) mutations frameshift nonsense mutations predicted cause truncation A-T protein; less common mutation types missense (9/71, 13%), splicing (3/71, 4%) one in-frame deletion, 2546 3 (1/71, 1%). The mean survival height distribution 134 A-T patients correlated significantly specific mutations present patients. Patients homozygous single truncating mutation, typically near N-terminal end gene, heterozygous in-frame deletion 2546 3, shorter significantly shorter survival heterozygous splice site missense mutation, heterozygous two truncating mutations. Alterations length amino acid composition A-T gene product affect A-T clinical phenotype different ways. Mutation analysis A-T locus may help estimate prognosis A-T patients.. Anticipation resulting elimination myotonic dystrophy gene: follow study one extended family. We re-examined extended myotonic dystrophy (DM) family, previously described 1955, order study long term effects anticipation DM particular implications families affected disease. This follow study provides data 35 gene carriers 46 asymptomatic risk family members five generations. Clinical anticipation, defined cascade mild, adult, childhood, congenital disease subsequent generations, appeared relentless process, occurring affected branches family. The cascade found proceed asynchronously different branches, mainly unequal number generations mild disease. The transition mild adult type associated transmission male parent. Stable transmission asymptomatic/mild phenotype showed female transmission bias. We examined extent causes gene loss pedigree. Gene loss patient group complete, owing infertility male patients adult onset disease fact mentally retarded patients procreate. Out 46 risk subjects two youngest generations, one found full mutation. This subject may transmit gene sixth generation. No protomutation carriers found fourth fifth generations. Therefore highly probable DM gene eliminated pedigree within one generation. The high population frequency DM present explained contribution asymptomatic cases younger generations known families, probably caused events ancestral generations.. Exon 9 mutations WT1 gene, without influencing KTS splice isoforms, also responsible Frasier syndrome. We report new mutations exon 9 WT1 gene alter ratio +/- KTS splice isoforms two unrelated patients Frasier syndrome (FS). The mutation intron 9 inducing defective alternative splicing reported responsible syndrome. The mutations found cases occurred exon WT1 gene detected Denys-Drash syndrome (DDS) could explained previously proposed mechanism. The results suggest two syndromes originate WT1 gene abnormality. From molecular biological point view, concluded two diseases separable, FS included atypical form DDS.. Deficit vivo mitochondrial ATP production patients Friedreich ataxia. Friedreich ataxia (FRDA), common inherited ataxias, autosomal recessive degenerative disorder, characterized clinically onset age 25 progressive gait limb ataxia, absence deep tendon reflexes, extensor plantar responses, loss position vibration sense lower limbs. FRDA caused GAA triplet expansion first intron FRDA gene chromosome 9q13 97% patients. The FRDA gene encodes widely expressed 210-aa protein, frataxin, located mitochondria severely reduced FRDA patients. Frataxin function still unknown knockout yeast frataxin homologue gene (YFH1) showed severe defect mitochondrial respiration loss mtDNA associated elevated intramitochondrial iron. Here report vivo evidence impaired mitochondrial respiration skeletal muscle FRDA patients. Using phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy demonstrated maximum rate muscle mitochondrial ATP production (V (max)) normal range 12 FRDA patients strong negative correlation mitochondrial V (max) number GAA repeats smaller allele. Our results show FRDA nuclear-encoded mitochondrial disorder affecting oxidative phosphorylation give rationale treatments aimed improve mitochondrial function condition.. Chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency patient familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). Molecular study new variant (G6PD Clinic) markedly acidic pH optimum. A new glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) variant severe erythrocytic G6PD deficiency unique pH optimum described young patient chronic nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA) familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy (FAP). Chronic hemolysis present absence infections, oxidant drugs ingestion faba beans. Residual enzyme activity 2. 6% 63% normal activity erythrocytes leucocytes, respectively. A molecular study using standard methods showed G6PD patient normal electrophoretic mobility (at pH 7. 0, 8. 0 8. 8), normal apparent affinity substrates (Km, G6P NADP) slightly abnormal utilization substrate analogues (decreased deamino-NADP increased 2-deoxyglucose-6-phosphate utilization). Heat stability found markedly decreased (8% residual activity 20 min incubation 46 degrees C) particular characteristic enzyme biphasic pH curve greatly increased activity low pH. Although molecular characteristics variant closely resemble G6PD Bangkok G6PD Duarte, distinguished previously reported variants virtue unusual pH curve. Therefore present variant designated G6PD Clinic distinguish G6PD variants previously described Regional localization polymorphic DNA loci proximal long arm X chromosome using deletions associated choroideremia.

A de novo unbalanced reciprocal translocation identified paternal origin Prader-Willi syndrome. Interstitial cytogenetic deletions involving paternally derived chromosome 15q11-13 described patients Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). We report child PWS de novo unbalanced karyotype -45, XY, -9, -15, + der (9) (9; 15) (q34; q13). Molecular studies DNA probe pML34 confirmed single Prader Willi critical region (PWCR 15q11. 2-q12) copy present. Hybridisation patient parental DNA multi-allelic probe CMW1, maps pter-15q13, showed chromosome involved translocation paternal origin. This first example paternally-derived PWCR allele loss caused unbalanced translocation arisen de novo. Clinicopathologic features BRCA-linked sporadic ovarian cancer. CONTEXT Most hereditary ovarian cancers associated germline mutations BRCA1 BRCA2. Attempts define clinical significance BRCA mutation status ovarian cancer produced conflicting results, especially regarding survival. OBJECTIVE To determine whether hereditary ovarian cancers distinct clinical pathological features compared sporadic (nonhereditary) ovarian cancers. DESIGN AND SETTING Retrospective cohort study consecutive series 933 ovarian cancers diagnosed treated institution, comprehensive cancer center designated National Cancer Institute, 12-year period (December 1986 August 1998). PATIENTS The study restricted patients Jewish origin ease BRCA1 BRCA2 genotyping ethnic group. From 189 patients identified Jewish, 88 hereditary cases identified presence germline founder mutation BRCA1 BRCA2. The remaining 101 cases series associated BRCA mutation 2 additional groups (Gynecologic Oncology Group protocols 52 111) ovarian cancer clinical trials (for survival analysis) included comparison. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Age diagnosis, surgical stage, histologic cell type grade, surgical outcome; response chemotherapy survival advanced-stage (II IV) cases. RESULTS Hereditary cancers rarely diagnosed age 40 years common age 60 years, mean age diagnosis significantly younger BRCA1- vs BRCA2-linked patients (54 vs 62 years; P =. 04). Histology, grade, stage, success cytoreductive surgery similar hereditary sporadic cases. The hereditary group longer disease-free interval following primary chemotherapy comparison nonhereditary group, median time recurrence 14 months 7 months, respectively (P <. 001). Those hereditary cancers improved survival compared nonhereditary group (P =. 004). For stage III cancers, BRCA mutation status independent prognostic variable (P =. 03). CONCLUSIONS Although BRCA-associated hereditary ovarian cancers population surgical pathological characteristics similar sporadic cancers, advanced-stage hereditary cancer patients survive longer nonhereditary cancer patients. Age penetrance greater BRCA1-linked BRCA2-linked cancers population. Germline intronic exonic mutations Wilms' tumour gene (WT1) affecting urogenital development.

Chromosome breakage Prader-Willi Angelman syndromes involves recombination large, transcribed repeats proximal distal breakpoints. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) Angelman syndrome (AS) distinct neurobehavioral disorders often arise 4-Mb deletion chromosome 15q11-q13 paternal maternal gametogenesis, respectively. At de novo frequency approximately. 67-1/10, 000 births, deletions represent common structural chromosome change human genome. To elucidate mechanism underlying events, characterized regions contain two proximal breakpoint clusters distal cluster. Novel DNA sequences potentially associated breakpoints positionally cloned YACs within near regions. Analyses rodent-human somatic-cell hybrids, YAC contigs, FISH normal rearranged chromosomes 15 identified duplicated sequences (the END repeats) near breakpoints. The END-repeat units derived large genomic duplications novel gene (HERC2), many copies transcriptionally active germline tissues. One five PWS/AS patients analyzed date identifiable, rearranged HERC2 transcript derived deletion event. We postulate END repeats flanking 15q11-q13 mediate homologous recombination resulting deletion. Furthermore, propose active transcription repeats male female germ cells may facilitate homologous recombination process. A 4-megabase YAC contig spans Langer-Giedion syndrome region human chromosome 8q24.1: use refining location trichorhinophalangeal syndrome multiple exostoses genes (TRPS1 EXT1). We constructed physical map covering 4 Mb human chromosome 8q24. 1 used map refine locations genes responsible Langer-Giedion syndrome. The map composed overlapping YAC clones identified ordered relation sequence tagged sites mapped Langer-Giedion chromosomal region somatic cell hybrids. The minimal region overlap Langer-Giedion syndrome deletions, previously identified analysis 15 patients, placed map analysis 2 patients whose deletions define endpoints. The chromosome 8 breakpoint balanced (8; 9) (q24. 11; q33. 3) translocation patient trichorhinophalangeal syndrome (TRPS I) found located within proximal end minimal deletion region. A deletion 8q24. 11-q24. 3 patient multiple exostoses found overlap distal end LGS deletion region, indicating EXT1 gene distal TRPS1 gene supporting hypothesis Langer-Giedion syndrome due loss functional copies TRPS1 EXT1 genes Genetic mapping breast-ovarian cancer syndrome small interval chromosome 17q12-21: exclusion candidate genes EDH17B2 RARA. A susceptibility gene hereditary breast-ovarian cancer, BRCA1, assigned linkage analysis chromosome 17q21. Candidate genes region include EDH17B2, encodes estradiol 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase II (17 beta-HSD II), RARA, gene retinoic acid receptor alpha. We typed 22 breast breast-ovarian cancer families eight polymorphisms chromosome 17q12-21 region, including two EDH17B2 gene. Genetic recombination breast cancer trait excludes RARA consideration candidate gene BRCA1. Both BRCA1 EDH17B2 map 6 cM interval (between THRA1 D17S579) recombination observed two genes. However, direct sequencing overlapping PCR products containing entire EDH17B2 gene four unrelated affected women uncover sequence variation, previously described polymorphisms. Mutations EDH17B2 gene, therefore appear responsible hereditary breast-ovarian cancer syndrome. Single meiotic crossovers affected women suggest BRCA1 flanked loci RARA D17S78..

Sjogren-Larsson syndrome (SLS) autosomal recessive disorder characterized ichthyosis, mental retardation, spasticity, deficient activity fatty aldehyde dehydrogenase (FALDH). To define molecular defects causing SLS, performed mutation analysis FALDH gene probands 63 kindreds SLS. Among patients, 49 different mutations-including 10 deletions, 2 insertions, 22 amino acid substitutions, 3 nonsense mutations, 9 splice-site defects, 3 complex mutations-were found. All patients SLS found carry mutations. Nineteen missense mutations resulted severe reduction FALDH enzyme catalytic activity expressed mammalian cells, one mutation (798G-- > C [K266N]) seemed greater effect mRNA stability. The splice-site mutations led exon skipping utilization cryptic acceptor-splice sites. Thirty-seven mutations private, 12 mutations seen two probands European Middle Eastern descent. Four single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) found FALDH gene. At least four common mutations (551C-- > T, 682C-- > T, 733G-- > A, 798 + 1delG) associated multiple SNP haplotypes, suggesting mutations originated independently one occasion ancient SLS genes undergone intragenic recombination. Our results demonstrate SLS caused strikingly heterogeneous group mutations FALDH gene provide framework understanding genetic basis SLS development DNA-based diagnostic tests.. Severe-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency associated chronic hemolytic anemia, granulocyte dysfunction, increased susceptibility infections: description new molecular variant (G6PD Barcelona). Molecular, kinetic, functional studies carried erythrocytes leukocytes Spanish male G6PD deficiency, congenital nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia (CNSHA), increased susceptibility infections. G6PD activity absent patients red cells 2% normal leukocytes. Molecular studies using standard methods (WHO, 1967) showed G6PD patient slightly fast electrophoretic mobility pH 8. 0 otherwise normal properties (heat stability 46 degrees C, apparent affinity substrates, optimum pH, utilization substrate analogues). Other tests showed patients granulocytes engulf latex particles normally, impaired reduction nitroblue tetrazolium ferricytochrome-c well reduced iodination. Chemotaxis random migration patients granulocytes normal myeloperoxidase, leukocyte alkaline phosphatase (LAP), ultrastructural features. The molecular characteristics G6PD patient differed previously reported variants associated CNSHA, present variant provisionally called G6PD Barcelona distinguish G6PD variants previously described. Possible mechanisms severe deficiency G6PD erythrocytes granulocytes investigated studies immunologic specific activity mutant enzyme. Mutations PAX6 locus found heterogeneous anterior segment malformations including Peters' anomaly. Mutation deletion PAX6 gene underlies many cases aniridia. Three lines evidence converge implicate PAX6 widely anterior segment malformations including Peters anomaly. First, child Peters anomaly deleted one copy PAX6. Second, affected members family dominantly inherited anterior segment malformations, including Peters anomaly heterozygous R26G mutation PAX6 paired box. Third, proportion Sey/+ Smalleye mice, heterozygous nonsense mutation murine Pax-6, ocular phenotype resembling Peters anomaly. We therefore propose variety anterior segment anomalies may associated PAX6 mutations.. In Swedish families hereditary prostate cancer, linkage HPC1 locus chromosome 1q24-25 restricted families early-onset prostate cancer. Prostate cancer clusters families, estimated 5% -10% cases estimated result inheritance prostate cancer-susceptibility genes. We previously reported evidence linkage 1q24-25 region (HPC1) 91 North American Swedish families multiple cases prostate cancer (Smith et al. 1996). In present report analyze 40 (12 original 28 newly identified) Swedish families hereditary prostate cancer (HPC) that, basis 40 markers spanning 25-cM interval within 1q24-25, evidence linkage. In complete set families, maximum two-point LOD score 1. 10 observed D1S413 (at recombination fraction [theta] of. 1), maximum NPL (nonparametric linkage) Z score 1. 64 D1S202 (P =. 05). The evidence linkage region originated almost exclusively subset 12 early-onset (age < 65 years) families, yielded maximum LOD score 2. 38 D1S413 (straight theta = 0) NPL Z score 1. 95 D1S422 (P =. 03). Estimates heterogeneity tests suggest that, within Sweden, many 50% early-onset families evidence linkage HPC1 region. These results consistent hypothesis linkage HPC1 subset families prostate cancer, particularly early age diagnosis. Localisation myotonic dystrophy locus 19q13.2-19q13.3 relationship twelve polymorphic loci 19q. The order fourteen polymorphic markers localised long arm human chromosome 19 established multipoint mapping set 40 CEPH (Centre dEtude de Polymorphisme Humain, Paris) reference families. We report linkage relationship myotonic dystrophy (DM) locus twelve markers studied 45 families DM. The resulting genetic map supported localisation DNA markers panel somatic cell hybrids. Ten twelve markers shown proximal DM gene two, PRKCG D19S22, distal distances approximately 25 cM 15 cM, respectively. The closest proximal markers APOC2 (apolipoprotein C-II) CKM (creatine kinase, muscle) approximately 3 cM 2 cM DM gene respectively, order APOC2-CKM-DM. The distance APOC2, CKM DM (of order 2 million base pairs) known orientation permit directional chromosome walking jumping. The data presented enable us determine whether new markers distal APOC2/CKM thus potentially flank DM gene.. A recurrent expansion maternal allele 36 CAG repeats causes Huntington disease two sisters. Large intergenerational repeat expansions CAG trinucleotide repeat HD gene well documented male germline. We describe recurrent large expansion maternal allele 36 CAG repeats (to 66 57 repeats, respectively, two daughters) associated onset Huntington disease (HD) second third decade family without history HD. Our findings give evidence gonadal mosaicism unaffected mother. We hypothesize large expansions also occur female germline negative selection oocytes long repeats might explain different instability behavior male female germlines.. Germline E-cadherin gene (CDH1) mutations predispose familial gastric cancer colorectal cancer. Inherited mutations E-cadherin gene (CDH1) described recently three Maori kindreds familial gastric cancer. Familial gastric cancer genetically heterogeneous clear proportion gastric cancer susceptibility non-Maori populations due germline CDH1 mutations. Therefore, screened eight familial gastric cancer kindreds British Irish origin germline CDH1 mutations, SSCP analysis 16 exons flanking sequences. Each family contained (i) two cases gastric cancer first degree relatives one affected age 50 years; (ii) three cases gastric cancer. Novel germline CDH1 mutations (a nonsense splice site) detected two families (25%). Both mutations predicted truncate E-cadherin protein signal peptide domain. In one family evidence non-penetrance susceptibility gastric colorectal cancer; thus, addition six cases gastric cancer, CDH1 mutation carrier developed colorectal cancer age 30 years. We confirmed germline mutations CDH1 gene cause familial gastric cancer non-Maori populations. However, minority familial gastric cancers accounted CDH1 mutations. Loss E-cadherin function implicated pathogenesis sporadic colorectal cancers, findings provide evidence germline CDH1 mutations predispose early onset colorectal cancer. Thus, CDH1 investigated cause inherited susceptibility gastric colorectal cancers. Germinal mosaicism Duchenne muscular dystrophy. We identified Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) pedigree disease associated molecular deletion within DMD locus. We examined meiotic segregation products common female ancestor using marker restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) detected probes lie within deletion. These studies show female transmitted three distinct types X chromosome offspring. This observation may explained postulating mutation arose postzygotic deletion within common ancestor, consequently germinally mosaic.. Expression murine Duchenne muscular dystrophy gene muscle brain. Complementary DNA clones isolated represent 5 terminal 2. 5 kilobases murine Duchenne muscular dystrophy (Dmd) messenger RNA (mRNA). Mouse Dmd mRNA detectable skeletal cardiac muscle level approximately 90 percent lower brain. Dmd mRNA also present, much lower normal levels, muscle brain three different strains dystrophic mdx mice. The identification Dmd mRNA brain raises possibility relation human Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene expression mental retardation found DMD males. These results also provide evidence mdx mutations allelic variants mouse Dmd gene mutations. Human peroxisomal targeting signal-1 receptor restores peroxisomal protein import cells patients fatal peroxisomal disorders. Two peroxisomal targeting signals, PTS1 PTS2, involved import proteins peroxisome matrix. Human patients fatal generalized peroxisomal deficiency disorders fall least nine genetic complementation groups. Cells many patients deficient import PTS1-containing proteins, causes protein-import defect patients unknown. We cloned sequenced human cDNA homologue (PTS1R) Pichia pastoris PAS8 gene, PTS1 receptor (McCollum, D., E. Monosov, S. Subramani. 1993. J. Cell Biol. 121 761-774). The PTS1R mRNA expressed human tissues examined. Antibodies human PTS1R recognize protein human, monkey, rat, hamster cells. The protein localized mainly cytosol also found associated peroxisomes. Part peroxisomal PTS1R protein tightly bound peroxisomal membrane. Antibodies PTS1R inhibit peroxisomal protein-import PTS1-containing proteins permeabilized CHO cell system. In vitro-translated PTS1R protein specifically binds serine-lysine-leucine-peptide. A PAS8-PTS1R fusion protein complements P. pastoris pas8 mutant. The PTS1R cDNA also complements PTS1 protein-import defect skin fibroblasts patients--belonging complementation group two--diagnosed neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy Zellweger syndrome. The PTS1R gene localized chromosomal location peroxisomal disorder genes known map. Our findings represent case molecular basis protein-import deficiency human peroxisomal disorders understood. X-linked spastic paraplegia Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease allelic disorders proteolipid protein locus. Three forms X-linked spastic paraplegia (SPG) defined. One locus (SPG 1) maps Xq28 two clinically distinct forms map Xq22 (SPG2). A rare X-linked dysmyelinating disorder central nervous system, Pelizaeus-Merzbacher disease (PMD), also mapped Xq21-q22, caused mutations proteolipid protein gene (PLP) encodes two myelin proteins, PLP DM20. While narrowing genetic interval containing SPG2 large pedigree, found PLP closest marker disease locus, implicating PLP possible candidate gene. We found point mutation (His139Tyr) exon 3B affected male produces mutant PLP normal DM20, segregates disease (Zmax = 6. 63, theta = 0. 00). It appears, therefore, SPG2 PMD allelic disorders
